I started reading Jon Gjengset's\nRust for Rustaceans (great book and criminally underpriced, you\nshould go read it) which influenced some of my design choices for the crate I built for the project.\nFollowing the \"contributing to open source\" goal I set for myself for the year, I started opening\nvarious pull requests, mostly in Rust\nprojects. These are small and simple contributions but I am planning on working my way up in\nterms of complexity over the rest of the year and you have to start somewhere :) A nice step up was\na small patch I created for\nVeloren which was my first contribution to a really big, production\ncodebase (over 200k lines of code) without any particular guidance.\nI decided to spend some time writing a few more \"useful\" blog posts such as\nPython with a bit of Rust and\nFinding Rust crates which combined gathered around 1000 reads\nover 3 weeks!\n\nHaving finished Rust for Rustaceans, I started reading the brilliant\nRust Atomics and Locks by Mara Bos. This has been very insightful\nboth when it comes to low-level concurrency but also unsafe and more advanced Rust, definitely\nrecommended!\nThe book proved useful in a few areas of my Software Project where for 2 months, I and 5\nother colleagues worked together in \"developing a cheap little robot to teach children and students\nalike robotics and computer vision called Mirte\". The project aimed\nto both get the robot to drive around a model city on\nvery limited hardware\nand to create interfaces of varying complexity to our code and the robot directly so as to allow\nthe users to implement the self-driving algorithms themselves.\nThe project was a success and it was really interesting to work on. Conveniently for me, we used\nRust so I felt at home! Being more experienced in the language (and in projects) than my colleagues,\nI took responsibility for architecting key areas of the project as well as identifying various areas\nand problems that needed to be tackled early to avoid time sinks in the future.\nApart from learning a lot of new things while working on the project, it was really cool to see\nhow a lot of things I had learned over time through my side projects contributed to this one\n(even that Scala testing framework I had made\nfor a friend's compiler turned out to be useful). There was also one instance where I removed a bunch\nof unsafe, raw pointer code with 2-3 safe method calls which I was very proud of.\nAfter all that was done and settled, I made a\nMandelbrot set renderer which I think looks\npretty cool. I also finally got around to looking into SIMD to make it faster, dove\na bit into constant generics and macros and wrote a\nblog post about them which surprisingly amassed over 1300 reads!\nA while after having watched\nDylan Beattie's talk called \"Plain Text\", I decided to dig into\nUnicode a bit more. The first time I encountered issues related to Unicode confusables was during\nmy first internship, specifically with different double quote characters. As I often want to learn\nabout multiple things per project, I decided to explore compile-time evaluation and parsing with\nRust as well as creating bindings for JavaScript's Node runtime. It was quite a fun project to\nwork on which you can find here.\n2022\nThis is the first time I decided to set some goals for myself.\nI decided to start by tackling one of them which was 'create and publish a NuGet package that does\nsomething useful' and thus, Rember was created. Rember\nis a CLI tool that lets you easily configure git hooks and is currently available both on Nuget and\nChocolatey. This was the first time I packaged a project of mine and made it available to the\nbroader public through a more general-purpose manager and it definitely was a great experience.\nI was getting more and more interested in working on things like libraries and frameworks and I\nthankfully had the chance to work on one. A friend of mine is developing\nhis own compiler and I decided to build a small testing\nframework for it. I got to dive into things like reflection and multi-threading and it has\nbeen a great learning experience seeing this project grow. I also consider the blog post I made\nabout it to be the most detailed one so far so that is also nice.\nThis sparked an interest in learning more about optimizations and concurrency as well as other\nthings like source generators.\nOver the summer I decided to refine my knowledge of scalability and architecture design. I learned\nmore about load balancing with Nginx and Caddy, monitoring applications using InfluxDB and Grafana,\nCQRS, event sourcing, different database strategies, bringing all that together with Docker and\nperforming load testing with k6. All the reading that I did over this period has greatly helped me\nunderstand\nscalability and more importantly, how (and when) to build for scale as well as identify the parts\nof a project that can be scaled and how to go about doing that.\nI learned a bunch more stuff about parallel and asynchronous programming which I'll be glad to make use\nof at some point.\nI decided to start learning Rust while building\nmy own Programming language, inspired by my\naforementioned friend. Turns out, compilers are rather complicated and LLVM is not any better.\nI looked into syntax highlighting and neat error reporting as well.\nSometime after that, I decided to work on Rss2email\nto extend my Rust knowledge. Having finished it as of writing this, I must say I find it quite\nuseful actually! I used some of the stuff I'd learned previously to package the project in a slim\nDocker image and make it easy to host on AWS Lambda.\n2021\nI got comfortable with deploying my projects. Learned how to work with Heroku and automate my\nbuilds, tests and deployments. I finished and deployed the chess game. I learned more about Docker\nand how to package my apps with it.\nI wrote my first article on Spring Boot after polishing my knowledge of it a bit more and posted it\nto help my fellow students prepare for an upcoming course.\nAfter taking a short break from learning on my own, I learned how to publish an npm package,\nFakeDB which to this day I am unsure as to whether it\nworks or not and looking back, I am too scared to check.\nI started working on Gromceri which was the biggest project I had\ntackled so far. Learned about authentication and JWTs in particular. Learned a lot about C# and the\n.NET ecosystem.  I learned how to securely deploy public repositories without giving all my\ncredentials and secret tokens away. I worked on database optimizations as well as logging. For the\nfirst (and coincidentally last) time I used GraphQL in this project.\nAfter working on that for a few months I went back to python to learn a bit of Django\nand FastAPI to prepare for my first internship. I dove into NLP using python with Spacy, Bert and\nPyTorch and a lot of regular expressions for my first internship. There, I also worked on API\ndevelopment with Python and Azure Functions as well as dove into asynchronous programming and\nprofiling for the first time.\n2020\nSome of the earliest programming I ever did was making Discord bots with DiscordJS. Motivated to\nlearn more about Javascript, I worked on my first 'big' project:\ncoronaBot.\nFor no apparent reason, I decided to learn some basics about Linux (I briefly used Arch by the way),\nBash and regex.\nI got pulled into the realm of Machine and Deep learning, as well as Data Science and I learned a\nfew basics about all 3 of these starting with Python but decided to switch to R. I discovered Kaggle\nand entered 2 competitions in which I was really proud to score fairly above average.\nThis is where University started so I had to drop working on these and I went for stuff that was\nmore relevant to my program. I familiarized myself with the Java ecosystem some more. I learned\nabout Maven and Gradle, testing and some basic  CI/CD + automated test coverage reports. I learned\nSQL and started teaching myself about Spring Boot while also starting work on a multiplayer, browser\nchess game.\n2019\nThis is when I first got formally introduced to programming and Computer Science in general.\nI learned the basics of Java, and Javascript and wrote a few X86 Assembly scripts (don't ask).\nLearned the concepts of Object Oriented Programming as well as some stuff about Functional concepts.\nGot introduced to algorithms and abstract data structures. Began learning the basics of relational,\ndocument and graph databases.\nThere was not much self-learning throughout this year in contrast to the next ones since\nI was still very new to the field.\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/about/","title":"About Me"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/main/":{"body":"Hello there!\nWelcome to my personal website!\nI'm Antonios Barotsis, a Computer Science &amp; Engineering student from Greece\ncurrently studying at TU Delft.\n\nYou can find more details about me here\nI also write blog posts sometimes.

I had this tweet pinned\nto remind myself of these goals, to reflect on them once the year was past and to come up with\nnew goals for the next year, so time to do just that!\nA lot has changed over this last year when it comes to my views and approach to software &amp;\nprogramming as a whole (which is always a good thing) so let's talk about that!\nCode Complexity\nI came across the following image through a retweet (which got deleted for some reason) which I\nfeel perfectly summarizes this past year for me.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nI spent most of the first half of 2022 looking into \"enterprise software development\" or in other\nwords, learning a bunch of design patterns and different abstractions in Java and C#.\nNow don't get me wrong, all these have some value to them, especially when working with a lot of\npeople. Design patterns are great in the sense that they are standard solutions to common problems.\nI can see their value if you are part of a big team developing software that you know\nis going to be actively worked on many years from now where the level of decoupling many of these\ndesign patterns offer is great for avoiding breaking changes. Not to mention that a lot of\nprogrammers will instantly recognize a lot of the more commonly used patterns and understand\nthe intent of the programmer that added it to the codebase which is also useful.\nOf course, thought must still be put into them as an inappropriate pattern can cause issues and make\nthe code harder to work with, as can the overuse of such patterns when they are not needed.\nLooking back at the earliest personal project I worked on this year\n(Rember), I cannot say I like the code I wrote as I\nnow find it unreasonably complicated on so many levels. For the simple job of essentially\nwriting some text to a file, I can very confidently say that I did not need to use abstract classes,\ninterfaces, builders, facades, singletons and other abstractions. Looking back, I could've\nwritten the whole project in a fraction of the code using just one struct and a builder.\nThat said, however, I'm both glad that I went through that and that I now feel like I know better.\nIt is undoubtedly useful to know of these patterns and understand that they can be used in\ncertain scenarios but it is also useful (arguably even more so) to understand when and where you\nshould use them. At the end of the day, design patterns are another tool in your belt and I'm\nglad I understand them a lot better than I did a year ago.\nThis whole idea of \"simpler\" code later pushed me to learn Rust which I'll come back to a bit later\nas I'm taking stuff in chronological order :)\nParallel Programming\nI had been interested in parallel programming for a while and I finally got around to learning\nsome basics this year!\nI read a bunch of stuff about parallel programming and especially its caveats and got to apply\nmost of that in 3 projects: Veritas, a university course titled \"Computational\nIntelligence\" and a Game of Life implementation.\nWith Veritas I learned about thread pools (albeit with pretty messy code) and locking for\nsynchronization. I experimented a lot to find a more efficient way of spawning some external\nprocesses used in testing a compiler.\nFor the university course, I got some experience in introducing parallelism to\nexisting code (of course making sure it was actually better) and making a neat, non-disruptive\ninterface for it, atomics and futures (which were not a new concept but learned some more about how\nthey work). I was implementing Ant Colony Optimization with 2 of my colleagues.\nMy game of life implementation was mostly about exploring numerous optimizations and\ndetermining where the performance bottleneck lied (which was mostly memory related) and how to\nplan around that.\nThere's definitely a lot more to learn and it's definitely one of the things I'll be trying to do\nover the next year. I also purchased my first-ever programming book\non Rust low-level concurrency which I look forward to reading :)\nThe last stretch of my abstraction obsession\nI had a sudden interest in System Design and Software Architecture sometime roughly in the middle\nof the year.\nI learned a lot about the bottlenecks in big systems (aka databases), application monitoring and\ntelemetry with tools like InfluxDB and Grafana, some basic load balancing and reverse proxying\nwith K6 and Nginx and a bunch of different ways of alleviating pressure from databases to make a\nsystem faster and more responsive. I also learned a bunch more about Docker and some Kubernetes\nbasics.\nA lot of my research into this came from speeches given or organized by AWS which eventually lead\nme to want to find a project that used their platform (especially since Heroku dropped their free\ntiers). I ended up suggesting to my dad that I built him an automated SMS service that sends\nreminders to his patients when their bookings are near which (just as Rember had too many design\npatterns) taught me a bunch about deployments with Docker (again) and testing as I needed to\nhave a certain quality standard since I was not going to be the one using it. Understanding the\nvalue of proper logging and alerts was another benefit of working on this. I, unfortunately, had\nto deal with parsing date times and phone numbers but at least I can now say that I have survived\nthat!\nEverything is overly complicated - burnout\nI feel like, after learning a bunch of all this convoluted stuff about high-profile enterprise\nsoftware and good practices and fancy new stuff and whatnot, I ended up realizing that the vast\nmajority of people that use these ideas and concepts, do not operate at a scale that needs them.\nI had also started to dislike bloated software and software that would just not do the one thing\nit was designed to do without crashing a few times here and there (looking at you NPM and PIP).\nI stumbled upon some people like Jonathan Blow\nwho have very vocal (although sometimes a bit extreme) opinions on this topic which really pushed\nme to adopt this idea of \"minimal and working\" software, both in the software that I use\n(as in the form of libraries) in my projects and in the software that I make.\nThese ideas pushed me to start learning Rust as it embraces and often encourages this idea of\ncorrectness, simplicity and efficiency.\nRust 🦀\nI worked on Rss2Email in the last few months of\n2022 (also wrote a blog post on it) which was both a ton of fun and a great\nlearning experience. I have a few ideas of stuff that I would like to build with Rust next but\nnothing too concrete yet so we'll see what's next I guess.\nRust to me is more than just the programming language, it's a collection of tools and software\nthat prioritize the ideals that I mentioned earlier. Learning more about it has been a blast and\nI don't think I've ever been more passionate about a specific tool before. I will definitely\nfocus most of my time in 2023 on learning more about it.\nThere are way too many great things about Rust to list in one paragraph so if anyone is actually\nreading this and you haven't tried it, please do! Take your time to learn the basics and I'm sure\nyou'll come to appreciate it immensely just as I  did :)\nI am in fact so passionate about Rust that I am having my first-ever live talk/workshop on it at my\nUniversity's Google Student Developer Club\nsometime in January which I'm super excited about!\nReviewing my goals from last year\nAfter having talked about all this stuff, I want to come back to these goals again and talk about\nthem a little bit.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n   \n\n\n\n\n❌ finish Demeter: Demeter was this toy project I started to get some more experience with C#\nand enterprise-ish concepts which I ended up dropping pretty soon. I got my experience from\nRember and that SMS service I built for my dad which was both a lot more fun (and realistic)\nand I generally drifted away from that type of software. The stuff that I was going to try and\ndo in the project was nothing new to me (which is also why I got bored of it pretty\nquickly) so I'm not really sad that I didn't end up finishing it.\n🤷‍♀️ .NET IoT: I don't recall having anything particular in mind when I wrote this. I think I may\nhave thought of this because I bought a Raspberry Pi, not really sure. In any case, it's not\nsomething I am really interested in anymore although I guess if that suddenly changes, I am\nprobably better equipped for it seeing as how I am somewhat familiar with Rust.\n✅ Nuget package: I did do this with Rember so that's nice. This was not really about\nNuget in particular, just generally publishing something. I also published Rss2Email which\nhad a much more complicated deployment pipeline which I'm proud of and unlike Rember, I am\nactually using it!\n✅ ORM: I am realizing that I am bad at setting goals, not because this was too hard or vague\nbut because it is not exactly what I wanted to do. I was interested in some of the stuff that\nmade ORMs work in languages like Java and C# such as reflection and code generation, both of which\nI explored in at least one project so while I technically did not do this, I satisfied my\ncuriosity on the topics that made me write it down, which is why I consider this \"technically\"\ncomplete :)\n✅ student team I guess the Google Student Developer Club isn't exactly a \"research\" team but\nit works for me. I have the chance to interact with a bunch of cool people and also share my\npassion for software through talks and workshops which is what I was going for\n✅ kubernetes: I did do quite a bit of reading up (and a bit of playing around) with Kubernetes\nwhen I was looking into system design. I definitely went over the stuff that I had in mind\nso I guess I also consider this one complete.\n\nI actually did better than I thought which is nice!\nOne takeaway I have from these goals is that I need to actually understand what it is that I want\nto learn as, more often than not, I am more interested in exploring specific concepts that may or\nmay not appear in certain types of projects instead of those projects themselves. Can't wait to\nmake the same mistake for the next year's goals!\nThe state of this website\nI haven't really mentioned anything about this so I just felt like writing some stuff here cause\nwhy not.\nI quite like how it looks for one, the theme is great and simplistic (fitting!).\nThe look and feel of the website plus the ability to mess around with it and try new things are\nthe main reasons why I'm glad I went for the custom approach instead of using existing platforms,\nwould definitely recommend anyone reading this to do the same if you're interested in blogging or\njust making a landing page for yourself on the interweb.\nI also feel somewhat comfortable with Hugo and messing around with its templating which was really\nconfusing to me a year ago for some reason.\nI think that my blog posts are getting better over time although I have different goals for each\npost so that progress might not be apparent to third parties but I feel good about it yup 👍\nI do kind of wanna go over my about page and rewrite some parts but other than that, everything\nis nice.\nI also played around with analytics services for a bit, switched from Google analytics because\nevery browser and browser plugin blocks that to Umami which was cool but\nI couldn't host it for free indefinitely so I switched again to Posthog\nwhich provides a free tier. In case anyone is reading this and is willing to pay,\nPlausible seems pretty good and I've been hearing nice stuff about it.\nI'm also happy with the number of posts I made. I made a post each time I worked on something\ninteresting, will definitely try to keep this up for the upcoming year!\nMy 2023 goals\nI was vaguely interested in this idea of zero-copy deserialization ever since I made a few\ncontributions to this repository and at some point, I found\nthis great talk on it which made me really interested in the\nconcept. Zero-copy deserialization is definitely something I want to look into over the next year.\nI already mentioned how I want to learn and practice more concurrent programming but I also want\nto learn more about distributed computing which is somewhat, vaguely related to concurrent in some\nways? Some of the ideas between them are somewhat similar, do not question how my interests appear.\nI've been interested in developer tooling and libraries for some time now and although I've already\nput in some work for both of these, I would love to work on them some more, I like feeling like\nI'm useful to other developers 👍\nLastly, I kinda wanna try and contribute to open-source projects a bit more. It is definitely not\nan easy thing to do but you kind of have to start somewhere. I already found myself contributing\nmore than in previous years either by opening issues or with actual PRs, most of which were in Rust\nprojects! This is definitely the scariest to-do on the list but I know I'll be very proud to make it\nwork so, only time will tell!\nLearning from the previous year, I tried not to include specific projects this year\nalthough I do have some in mind already, some combine multiple items from my list which is nice.\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n   \n\n\n\nTill next year by when I will have hopefully completed all of these!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/2022-recapped/","title":"2022 Recapped"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/2023-recapped/":{"body":"Introduction\nThis year felt rather quick for some reason, I feel like I barely remember anything from before\nsummer.\nWell anyway, earlier this year I set some goals to work towards throughout the year, just like\nthe year before;\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n   \n\n\n\nIt has been quite some time since and reflecting on stuff that happens over a year is something I\nalways find interesting. Also probably a good idea to come up and write down some goals for the\nupcoming year, even if I'm a few days late.\n2023 Goals Recap\nLearn more Rust\nLast year I wrote that\n\n\"I will definitely focus most of my time in 2023 on learning more about it.\"\n\nAnd I definitely did. The fact that rss2email was a whole year ago is crazy to me\nbecause that's what kickstarted my Rust arc.\nI already mentioned the individual projects I worked on here and you can also see\nthe repositories\non my Github\nalthough a few private ones are omitted. The 2 notable ones are the ones mentioned in\nthis and this blog posts.\nI also read through a lot of articles and a couple of books on the language, both of which I\nlearned a lot from and will definitely continue to do next year. I still have a few books I have\nbought but have yet to read so I need to try and stop impulsively buying new ones before those are\ndone 😅\nI even attended a few local conferences!\nBuild a decent TUI app\nNever really came up with an idea for this, even though I always had it at the back of my mind. I\nguess I can say I finally did some UI\nat last but TUI specifically.\nTo be honest, I don't really mind not having done this as, again, I didn't have a good reason to\nat any point but I'll be keeping it in mind throughout 2024 as well. I think some sort of\ndashboard could be cool, I'll likely revisit this if I get around to doing anything related to\ndistributed systems stuff as it could be useful for debugging and observing what is going on.\nLearn (and apply?) distributed systems basics\nDid not do quite as much as I had in mind but then again, I did not know too much about this to\nset any sort of accurate goals for this anyway.\nI started reading \"Designing Data-Intensive Applications\" by Martin Kleppmann\nwhich touches on quite a few interesting and relevant topics but I still have a decent chunk of the\nbook to finish. I also took a look and did ~half of the\nFly.io distributed systems challenges.\nMy main issue with distributed systems is that it is quite hard to find a problem that I have that\ncould be solved by distributed systems as usually the scale required for them is way bigger than\nanything I am dealing with. I could build something arbitrarily like a distributed cache but I like\nworking on things that I will actually use or at least need once.\nOne idea that I have for this is perhaps looking into the\nActor model as that should share some of the same\nphilosophies of distributed systems. Of course, a lot of stuff will probably not overlap but it is\nbetter than nothing.\n\nLook into zero-copy deserialization &amp; parsing in general\nWell, I did make an ASCII Grid format\nparser, as well as needed to do some parsing in\nShuttle's Christmas Code Hunt. The former used\nnom and a bunch of lifetimes that technically qualify\nas zero-copy. I also used pest in that project which I\nfound easier.\nI definitely feel like I could use some more practice but when is that not the case ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nApply concurrent programming\nThis went quite well!\nI applied a lot of stuff from the Rust Atomics and Locks book in\nmy University software project (the one with the self driving robot), some of\nmy solutions\nto Shuttle's Christmas Code Hunt (a previous iteration was quite a bit more complex but I ended up\nscraping it), my Mandelbrot set renderer as well\nas my controller ui.\nI ended up using some SIMD in my Mandelbrot renderer as well which was quite interesting and I also\nended up reading a lot about SIMD-able sorting algorithms for whatever reason which are\nquite cool!\nDevelop a general-purpose library for devs\nI'm pretty happy with this as well. The two most notable ones have got to be my Software project\nand the confusables library.\nIn the Software project I worked on library functions that the students using our platform would use\nas well as a testing framework for testing some of our ROS node code that we ourselves ended up using.\nAs for the confusables library, I stumbled upon the fantastic talk\n\"Plain Text\" by Dylan Beattie and ended up\nreading up on random Unicode things, eventually coming across confusables and making a library\nfor detecting them. I experimented with creating JavaScript bindings for the crate as well as\ncompile-time code generation. It also ended up getting a\nsurprising amount of downloads although I can't be sure how\nmany of those are automated and how many are actual use cases. Still pretty cool though.\nContribute more to Open Source\nThis was another good one, I feel like I made a\ndecent amount,\none of them was even towards the Rust compiler! (it was definitely not a typo in the docs somewhere\ndo not look it up)\nI also made a temporary bug fix for an\nopen source game I was playing at the time with a couple of friends. It was quite funny knowing I\nstopped dying to a bug that I myself had fixed once it was published.\n2024 Goals\nI think I want to shift my focus, at least partially, to reading more instead of building small\nprojects. Although they are fun, I feel like I am at a point where I've used Rust extensively and\ndoing more small projects won't teach me quite as much. I'll probably still build random stuff since\nthey're fun and often interesting/useful but I don't think there's a point in setting that as a\n\"goal\" necessarily. I still have 3-4 books (none Rust specific) I've bought and haven't\nfinished/started so I definitely want to be done with those and there are always more books to read\nif I'm done early.\nI still want to learn more about distributed systems. As I mentioned earlier, I find it hard to find\nsome tangible project idea that makes use of them to anchor myself to and build towards but reading\nmore about them is a good starting point so I'll be doing some more of that.\nLastly, and my main goal for the year, is to look into computational fluid dynamics and attempt to\nbuild a simulation showcasing either something like the aerodynamic properties of a car or some sort\nof water simulation. This is quite far outside the area of things I know so I really can't tell\nnow if the vague idea that I have of an end result is realistic to achieve over this year alone.\nRoughly what I have in mind is something like a wind tunnel\nsimulation where a car is placed in the middle of the frame and air is blown out of one side, allowing\nyou to see how it interacts with the various parts of the car. There are so many questions I need to\nanswer even before I start doing too much research on this such as:\n\ndo I want this to be in 2d or 3d?\nwhat will the performance look like and will I have to use a GPU? Does that affect my algorithm\nchoice?\nhow easy do I want creating objects to test to be?\nshould I aim to support importing objects via some standard format?\nhow do I even get things to show up on screen? Should I use like a game engine or something?\nis something like this possible in real-time or should I aim for more of a record and playback method?\n\nThis probably comes off a bit out of the blue for the type of stuff I usually do. Truth is, I've\njust been getting fascinated by the aerodynamics of (race)cars recently and I'm quite annoyed about\nthe fact that I don't understand how aerodynamics work at all. Unfortunately, I was never a physics\nperson so instead of reading a book about aerodynamics, I will instead simulate them as any\nnon-sensible software person would do.\nI would also like to blog some more this year and this whole aerodynamics arc could make for a nice\nlittle blog series.\nClosing\nOverall, I'm pretty happy with how the year went actually. I think I overall managed to hit or at\nleast make good progress towards all of them. Let's see how far I get this time!\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n   \n\n\n\nThis is more or less fewer goals than last year but you know what they say, less is more and the\nmore the merrier.\nTill next year!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/2023-recapped/","title":"2023-recapped"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/aim-for-the-stars/":{"body":"I Take Photos Actually\nI've been into photography for some time now and I've quite liked both astrophotography and\ndeep-sky photography. Somewhat recently I bought a\n105mm macro lens (for some reason\nthis is now more expensive than when I bought it??). While I was studying in the Netherlands,\nI didn't have too much time to dedicate purely to photography so I would shoot something here\nand there but nothing major.\nAstro was out of the question both because of the horrible light pollution the entire country\nhas but also because it is not something you just randomly decide to show up and do; shooting\nanything at night needs a good amount of planning as well as a good amount of shooting if you want\na half decent result, even for the simple stuff I was doing. I also didn't have a driver's license\nat the time which is arguably indispensable for this sort of thing.\n\nTLDR: I had never tried shooting at night with this lens.\n\nEven though I really loved shooting with\nit during the day, because of the long focal length, when I was walking around (and couldn't use\na tripod), I would start to struggle to get clean pictures from sunset already because of the lack\nof sufficient light.\nSeeing as how I was back home in Greece for the summer and a Perseid Meteor Shower was taking\nplace, the entire family decided to drive somewhere remote at night and spend an hour or so\nstar gazing. This was just about the perfect opportunity for me to try out the new lens at night.\nThroughout this post, I'll go over all the preparation and learning I had to do to take my\nfirst deep-sky photograph using just a lens I had, as well as how I processed it to improve it.\nI'll also talk about a bunch of adjacent stuff as one does.\nFirst Night\nOn the first night, I was not really aiming for anything specific. The plan was to get a feel\nfor what settings worked (ISO, exposure times, aperture etc) and to get something along the lines\nof \"cool mountain but with stars\". It was at this point that I was about to find out just how much\nmore apparent the rotation of the Earth is in my 105mm lens compared to the 55mm lens that came with\nmy camera. Before, I did not really have to care much, shooting at 20-30s would add a bit\nof star trails but not too much. I didn't have an intervalometer at the time so that's as high as I\ncould go anyway.\nI ended up with this:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThis shot was having an identity crisis (well it was for testing purposes so can't blame me too\nmuch I guess). I was trying to do terrain+stars+trails and the combination was just not working.\nI was shooting too short for nice trails, just enough for the terrain itself but more importantly\nI was just now realizing how \"zoomed in\" and somewhat uncomfortable this lens was to get what I was\nvery vaguely aiming for.\n\nDo not ask me why I was vaguely aiming for a wide angle shot with a 105mm lens\n\nI shot a few more stuff that was not really of note until eventually I just said \"whatever man,\nwhat if I shot for like 15 minutes lol\" and ended up with this\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nwhich again is not fantastic, however, it looks kinda cool.\nIt is also easy to notice that the star trails (albeit being incredibly cool), have a lot of jitter.\nIt was quite windy that day and my tripod is quite cheap so that didn't work out too well.\nBut this got me thinking, well, how do people take such nice pictures of the night sky if I can\nbarely shoot a mountain and like 7 stars.\nResearch Time\nWell as it turns out, it's just hard to shoot very long exposures for the 2 reasons I had already\nrealized: the Earth's rotation will blur out the stars or give them trails and the longer you shoot,\nthe chances that your tripod keeps the camera perfectly still dwindle. There are 2 ways to combat\nthese issues and ideally you want to use both in conjunction;\nImage Stacking\nThe first (and cheaper) option is a technique called image stacking. The idea is simple: instead\nof shooting one long exposure, shoot multiple short ones and blend them together into one image.\nThis eliminates both the star trail issue as well as greatly reduces ISO noise since you can just\nuse a smaller ISO.\nWell the \"just blend them together\" is doing a lot of heavy lifting. You could technically do this\nyourself in Photoshop but you should probably use an image stacking software such as\nDeep sky stacker. There are probably different ones you could use but this is the first one I found,\nit works and it is free and open-source.\nSoftware like this (to my current knowledge) effectively does 2 things;\n\nAligns all your images with each other using bright stars as anchor points\nBy blending and averaging out the light between the different pictures, it greatly reduces\nthe noise (which is by nature inconsistent and thus gets averaged out) and amplifies the star's\nlights which are consistent. It is sort of the same principle that makes long-exposure photos\n\"ignore\" movement and only register constant (or really bright, think car headlights) objects.\n\nThis does come with some hurdles. For one, you need to make sure whatever it is you are shooting\nis always centered, the Earth's movement is still an issue, we just pushed it further back.\nIt is a good idea to make sure your subject is centered every few minutes, in my case I checked\nevery 3 or so minutes but this will depend on both your focal length (the longer your FL the more\nfrequently you'll need to recenter) and how much of your frame your subject occupies.\nIn my case, 105mm was nowhere near enough to properly zoom in on the Andromeda Galaxy so since I\nknew I was going to crop the result anyway, I could afford to recenter my camera less frequently.\nThe Andromeda Galaxy is that vaguely brighter spec of light near the center of this image:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nConsidering that it is apparently estimated to be roughly 23605433496791683000 kilometers away\n(give or take some rounding error), it is insane that I can even see it with just my lens!\nAnother \"issue\" with image stacking is just how many photos you need. In my case I shot\n\n212 light frames\n40 dark frames\n30 flat frames\n50 bias frames\n\nfor a whopping total of 332 photos which amounts to 4+ GB. I will not claim to know how many of any\nof these frame types are \"good\" but the guides and articles I read beforehand usually shot more\nthan me, I was just constrained on time, it took almost an hour to get all of these.\nBut what are all those \"frames\"?\nLight frames are your \"normal\" pictures where you want to capture your subject with your camera\nsensor.\nThe rest are...\nCalibration Frames\nCalibration Frames are pictures you take to average out different types of noise your light frames\nwill have in order to end up with a cleaner picture.\nDark frames are meant to remove thermal noise which is affected by temperature, ISO and your\nexposure time. The way you take these is just after you are done with your light frames, you\njust put the cover cap on your lens and start shooting without changing the settings. It is\nimportant to take these on-site and right after you are done shooting your light frames as your\ncamera settings and environment affect some of the calibration frames so it is important to capture\nhow they are affected as your light frames will have the same issues.\nFlat frames are shot in Aperture mode and should be properly exposed. You remove the lens cap and\ncover up your lens with something white (maybe a shirt). These capture things like dust particles\non the lens as well as vignetting.\nFinally, we have the bias frames. These are shot at the lowest shutter speed your camera can handle\nand tackle the inherent sensor bias that cameras have (no sensor is perfect!).\nStar Trackers\nWhile stacking works great, it is not always enough, especially if you want to use high focal\nlengths (such as with telescopes). The problem as mentioned earlier is that you need to shoot\nshort exposures in order to not get star trails. The issue with that is that this severely limits\nthe amount of detail you can capture. Things like fainter stars and all their different colors\njust do not pop out well enough without longer exposures.\nSo what is a star tracker?\nIt is an expensive piece of equipment that sits between your tripod and your camera and slowly\nmoves your camera to counteract the rotation of the Earth, allowing you to shoot longer exposures\nwithout any issues. Some star trackers can apparently also point your camera to any celestial body\nyou want automatically which sounds pretty useful as we'll see later.\nI do not have one of these unfortunately so I can't comment a whole lot on them but if you are\ninterested in deep sky photography (especially with a telescope, this is a must), it sounds like\na worthy purchase if you can afford it.\nCamera Settings\nI have to once again mention that my combined experience in deep sky photography is one (1) picture.\nThese might not be optimal, but they are what I used to get going.\nTo get my shutter speed I used what is referred to as \"the 500 rule\". This states that your\nexposure time (in seconds) should be the result of 500 / (Crop-Factor x Focal Length)\nMy Nikon D5000 has a crop factor of 1.52 and since my lens is 105mm my exposure time is\n500 / (1.52 x 105) = ~3.1s which I rounded down to 3 seconds. I used\nthis site to find my crop factor.\nSome people prefer using the same formula but instead of 500 they use 400 or 300. I did not\ntry either of those out but seeing as how both of them result in shorter exposure times, I wanted\nto avoid them in order to get some more detail in my images + even at 3 seconds I did not get\nblurred results so that is good enough for me. There's also another heuristic called the NPF rule\nbut that one is more complicated to compute and I am lazy so I decided to not go for that.\nWhen it comes to the ISO, I couldn't really find anything specific. Many people seem to recommend\nsomething in the range of 1600-3200, I think I ended up with something in the middle.\nFinally your Aperture. This one is an interesting balancing act. Shooting wide open obviously lets\nmore light and consequently more details reach the sensor which is great, however, this also often\nresults in vignetting so it might be a good idea to not shoot completely wide open. But then again,\nif you increase the aperture you need more light so you need to shoot for longer and that can cause\nits own problems as discussed previously. In my case I was lucky because I knew I was going to crop\nmy image pretty heavily so I could just not care about vignetting since I would crop that out anyway.\nAnother thing I saw some people mention is that disabling your camera's either nighttime or long\nexposure noise reduction is a good idea. I would imagine that is because you will do your own\nnoise reduction with image stacking and later on in post but also because it takes a while for\nyour camera to process said noise reduction.\nYour ideal white balance setting might vary depending on things like the intensity of light\npollution and its warmth. In my case, a daylight WB worked nicely enough.\nPreparing for the Shot\nProbably the first thing to look at when it comes to planning is light pollution, both from things\nlike cities but also from the moon. I found this neat website\nthat puts light pollution estimates on a map so you can more easily find the darkest areas near you.\nI also used this website for both finding the Moon phases as well as\nwhen night starts.\n\nWhen the sun sets, even though we cannot see it directly it still illuminates the sky for a while\nafter it's gone. There are 3 types of \"twilight\" between the sunset and night, each designate\na different level of \"darkness\" which is just the degrees the sun is at below the horizon. In\norder of most bright to least bright those are Civil, Nautical and Astronomical twilight.\nI would imagine that Astronomical twilight is good enough for 99% of people (nautical might also\nbe good enough to be honest) but I prefer shooting at Night since I know I won't have to adjust\nmy settings at any point as it can't get any darker than that. Night seems to start just over\n90 minutes after sunset in my case.\n\nAt this point, you probably want to get your camera focused. This sounds deceptively trivial at\nfirst but the first few times you try it might be a bit harder than you'd expect. The issue is that\nautofocus cannot work and you should thus disable that and use manual focus instead. Try and find\na bright star, point your camera at it and turn on the camera's live view or whatever it is called.\nZoom into the star as much as your camera allows you to (usually this is a 10x zoom and yes I am\ntalking about a digital zoom, not optical zoom) and try and adjust your focus so the star appears as\nsmall as possible. After you've done that, be very careful to not mess up your focus accidentally.\nNow that you've focused on something that is not your subject, it is time to try and find the\nactual subject which can also be surprisingly difficult, at least the first few times. I definitely\nrecommend using something like Stellarium (or something similar, this is again free) on your phone\nto at least get a sense of the general direction of whatever it is you are trying to shoot.\nSearching for \"Andromeda galaxy\" in the app shows the following:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nWell the underlines I added myself, I'll come back to them in half a paragraph. The actual \"galaxy\"\nis that ellipsis titled M 31 where the M stands for Messier which likely has some significance\nand historical attribution I am unaware of so just pretend that says \"Andromeda Galaxy\" instead.\nBelieve it or not, it is nearly impossible to spot with the naked eye, even at night and with\nnear-zero light pollution. How do we find it then? Well, the 3 stars I underlined in red were\nreally bright and were very easy to spot. It was not too hard to aim my camera in the middle one,\nnamed \"Mirach\". The star above that, which I underlined in green, was super faint but visible with\nthe naked eye so I could see the general direction I had to aim to start seeing the Andromeda Galaxy.\nAfter taking a bunch of 10 or so second exposures just to aim my camera at an entire galaxy, I\neventually managed to do just that. I would imagine that this is quite common unless you have one\nof those fancy and expensive motorized stands that can aim your camera for you.\nTaking the Shot(s)\nNow time to shoot a few hundred photos and unless you want to do that by hand, you should buy an\nintervalometer. These are dirt cheap devices you can connect to your camera and they essentially\ncontrol the shutter. If you want to do things like shooting exposures longer than 30 seconds or\nshooting many pictures at intervals then this is a must-have tool. Make sure your camera's shutter\nspeed is set to bulb, pick the ISO you want and you can finally start shooting. In my case I shot\n50 3-second exposures with some added time between shots (like 4-5 seconds from what I remember) to\nmake sure my camera could keep up. This was around 5-6 minutes, at which point I had to stop and\nadjust my camera because the galaxy was on its way to escape my frame. I took 4 sets of these.\nDon't forget to also take your calibration frames at this point. Also, something to keep in mind is\njust how much space this can take up on your SD card, in my case I had just over 4GB of photos taken\njust for this.\nPost Processing\nNow that we've shot everything it is time to finally put it all together.\nDeep sky stacker is quite straightforward to use so I won't touch too much on that; you just\nselect your images, assign them into the correct category (light frames, bias frames etc) and let\nit do its thing. In the end you will end up with something that looks shockingly uneventful:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nI spent all this time and effort just to get this???\nFear not, for it should look something like that at this stage. You can just about make out that\nthere even is a galaxy present in the picture and from what I've read, even that might not be\nobvious in some cases.\nIt is time to throw that into Photoshop and do magic on it to make it look better. I can simply not\nstretch enough just how daunting this has sounded to me for years. Now don't get me wrong, it still\nsounds daunting and I still don't know what I'm doing but, making a photo like the one above\nlook somewhat cool is actually not quite as hard as it at least felt like it would be to me.\n\nI pretty much found out about all the things I am about to talk about through these 2 videos,\ndefinitely give them a watch if you're interested!\n\n3 EASY ASTROPHOTOGRAPHY Targets for Beginners!\nShooting &amp; Processing Orion Nebula with a DSLR and Tripod, NO TRACKER - Astrophotography Tutorial\n\n\nThe main goal of the edits we are about to do is to broaden the spectrum of light captured in the\nphoto. There's a good chance that the starting image is quite \"rough\" in that regard i.e. it goes\nfrom full black to white with not much in-between. By broadening the in-between, we increase\nthe contrast of all the different colors we captured. You don't want to overdo this however as that\nwill end up reducing the contrast between the pitch black sky and your subject.\nHere's a before and after of what that might look like:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nIn my case, I think the before was a bit too extreme and I think that is because I could not\nexpose for too long, although I am not entirely sure, that might just be normal for a starting\npoint.\nWe do this via the Levels menu which you can access via CTRL+L. We pretty much try to pull\nthe left and right borders closer to our peak, effectively stretching it.\nAnother similar modification involves the dreaded curves which you can access with CTRL+M. These\nalways seemed so cryptic but they're actually not that bad. We again aim to increase the contrast\nexcept this time we want to do that on specific areas of our image. By CTRL-clicking on areas of\nour image that are faint but we know should have more color, we get a point on our curves that\nrepresent those colors. What we can now do is lift the curve around that area to increase the\nbrightness of those colors and lower it on the other end of the histogram to, again, increase\ncontrast. This really makes some areas pop.\nHere's how that might look like with a before and after:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nThere are also a bunch of other things that we can do such as noise reduction filters, increasing\ncertain colors, upping saturation and vibrancy etc but generally speaking those are a lot more straightforward.\nIn the end, after all this stuff and post, I ended up with this!\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nI think it looks quite cool for a first attempt.\nI am not entirely sure what I can improve just yet. Just shooting more light frames is probably\nan easy one to point out. I'm also sure that I can improve my post-processing tremendously but not\nsure how just yet so I guess I'll have to experiment a bunch with that to see what works as well\nas go through some guides probably.\nHowever, that said, this brings us to...\nEquipment Matters\nPurchasing often expensive equipment is very common for anyone who has been into photography for a\nwhile, but I do think that deep-sky photography has both one of the largest selections of gear you\ncan buy as well as requires that you buy a bunch of things if you want to get nice pictures in the\nfirst place. There are very few things that you can't shoot well enough (at least at a beginner\nlevel) with just your average 55-65mm lenses that often come bundled with your camera. Sure there\nare some things that will be better with a lower or higher focal length, say 20-30 or around 100.\nBut those all have relatively cheap options, at least for photography standards. Not to mention they\nare all quite common, which means you can find used lenses if that's more your thing.\nBut for deep sky photography, you kinda need a telescope to get really cool pictures. And the issue\nis that that's a very specialized purchase. For example, I love my 105mm lens; I've shot neat\npictures of cars, buildings, even portraits and scenery which are traditionally shot on wide-angle\nlenses. It is a much more general piece of equipment, at roughly the same price as a telescope\nwhich does 1 thing only. And of course, once you get a telescope you really should also get a star\ntracker because finding your subjects would be exponentially harder at those focal lengths and\nyou wouldn't want to shoot without compensating for the rotation of the Earth either.\nMy point with all this is that you should meter your expectations if this is something that you\nwant to try out, without throwing a bunch of money at it. You can definitely shoot some cool stuff\nbut expecting to get something like those wallpapers you see on the internet is rather unreasonable.\nTHAT SAID, I must stress that I am talking about deep-sky photography. If you want to shoot\nthings like the Milky Way or just the stars, you can 100% do that with most lenses. Wide angles\ncould be better but not required.\nOther Possible Sky Subjects\nI couldn't really fit these in in any other paragraph so I'll just give them their own.\nSome common subjects that I've seen mentioned are the Orion Nebula, the Pleiades Star Cluster\n(which I will actually try and shoot tonight!) and the Rosette Nebula.\nThere's also this thing called The Messier Catalog of Deep Sky Objects which is a list of 110\ndeep-sky objects. You can sort these by ascending Apparent Magnitude which, the lower that is, the\neasier it should be to take pictures of.\nClosing\nOverall, I'm quite happy with all the things I learned and just the overall experience of taking the\npicture. It might not be of stellar quality (sorry) but when has that ever the case in a first\nattempt? It is also kinda interesting to put into perspective just how much work is really needed\nto get such a picture. I can only imagine the amount of effort some of the pictures I've seen\nonline must have needed.\nThis was quite a lengthy post (also the first one I've done that is not programming-related) but it\nwas interesting to write nonetheless. If I do get a neat picture of the Pleiades tonight, I'll be\nsure to add it here!\nAnd with that,\nTill next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/aim-for-the-stars/","title":"Aim for the stars"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/aspnet_testing/":{"body":"Introduction\nMost Web API templates I could find online do not have testing pre configured in them and the official ones do not have it at all so I thought\nthat I would make a post about setting up basic unit tests as well as mocking dependencies.\nI will be using XUnit which is one of the most used testing frameworks for .NET as well as\nFakeItEasy for mocking. In the end I will also use Coverlet\nand Codecov for coverage reports.\nThe API will be the weather forecast template with the addition of a service layer which is what we will be testing. Let's get started!\nCoding\nCreating the project\nI will be creating a solution with 2 projects, one being the API and the other one being the one for testing.\nWe start by creating a folder for the solution:\n\nWe can now create the API project and add it to our solution:\n\nSimilarly for our test project:\n\nRunning dotnet run --project src should spin up the server and sure enough, visiting https://localhost:5001/weatherforecast\nreturns us the expected responce.\nCreating the service\nI will create a Services folder and inside it add 2 files: a service interface and its implementation\n\n\nLet's head to our controller and make use of the service we just created there so we can make sure it works:\n\nLastly we head to Startup.cs to register the implementation\n\nIf we now run the app and hit the endpoint we should see Hello From MyDependency! logged in the console.\nWriting our tests\nLet's navigate to our test project and write our first test\n\nHere I changed the return type from void to async Task since the method we want to test is async. Running the test with\ndotnet test passes but this is not what we want.\nIn a normal project this method could require a database connection that we probably do not want to make use of in our tests for various reasons.\nThis is where mocking comes into play; we can provide a fake implementation to our service methods. It might not be as apparent here why this could\nbe useful so let me explain.\nUsually the way I like to structure my apps is to split them into 3 layers\n\nControllers: handle http requests, call service layer\nServices: business logic, call repository layer\nRepositories: Handle database queries\n\nComing from a Spring Boot background, my terminology might be a bit different than what is normally used for .NET projects but the idea is the same;\nsplit your logic into layers and use dependency injection to interact between them.\nThe most important layer to test is the service layer since that's where all the actual \"programming\" is. In order to test that I would have to mock\nmy repository interface and have it return arbitrary fake data without actually using the database. You can imagine how bad of an idea it would be\nif someone was to test creations, updates or deletions while using the actual database...\nThere are some other options such as using a different, in memory database for testing but we will not be covering that in this post.\nSo back to our test, how do we mock the dependency?\n\nUsing the FakeItEasy package we define an instance of the IMyDependency interface using A.Fake. This right now does nothing;\nwe have to explicitly define what happens when one of the interface methods gets called, we do that with A.CallTo  which accepts a lambda\nof the method in question. I am using Task.FromResult because the method is async. If we run the test we can see that it passes which means that\nwe successfully changed the \"implementation\" of our dependency. Again, this is what would normally be a repository and a database call changed to\nhard coded data, similar to what would be returned from said database call.\nAdding a CI pipeline with Codecov\nAnother thing we could do is add Codecov to get a detailed view of our test coverage. The best way to do that in my\nopinion is to create a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline on Github that will generate and push code coverage information everytime we update\nthe repository.\nFirst go to Codecov's website and create an account. Get your CODECOV_TOKEN and create a repository secret with its value on your github\nrepository, we will be using this later when we push our data to Codecov.\nWe also need to create a codecov.yml file with some basic configuration. Here's what I had from a previous project:\n\nThe only interesting thing about this is that I ignored every folder that does not include Services since that's the only thing we tested.\nLet's create the .github/workflows/dotnet.yml file and use the Github Actions template for .NET apps which includes building and testing.\nWe only have to add one more step for codecov to work:\n\nThe Codecov action offers a few useful parameters for you to use so if you are interested,\nread their docs!\nWith all this done and pushed you just want to wait for the Action to complete. After that's done I can take a look at my coverage\n\nThis is very useful to look at when dealing when more than one directory unlike here.\nYou can also take a look at the exact spots in your code that you tested/missed\n\nAnd finally (but certainly most importantly), codecov gives you a badge to display on your Github repo to show everyone how well tested your code\nis. What's the point of testing if you don't let everyone know you did after all?\nConclusion\nTesting is basically essential to any application that is not yet another personal project doomed to be abandoned a few weeks after its inception.\nIf you decide to test your project I do not see why you wouldn't include coverage reports, whether automated or not. Codecov (and other similar tools)\nallow you to set a lot of rules that would fail your pipeline if not met such as: minimum coverage, a minimum threshold of allowed coverage drop on new\ncommits and a lot more.\nI hope you got something out of this post and thanks for reading! :)\nYou can find the code here.\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/aspnet_testing/","title":"Testing an ASP .NET Core project"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/budget_fixture/":{"body":"BudgetFixture\nBudgetFixture is a very minimal (budget one could say), proof of concept - clone of the\nAutoFixture package in Java.\nMy repository can be found here.\nWhat is AutoFixture\nAutoFixture is a very handy .NET library that is\n\n\"designed to minimize the 'Arrange' phase of your unit\ntests in order to maximize maintainability. Its primary goal is to allow developers to focus on what\nis being tested rather than how to setup the test scenario, by making it easier to create object\ngraphs containing test data.\"\n\nWhat does that mean? In essence, it provides a neat interface for creating class instances for your\ntests with random data.\nIn their README they provide the following example:\n\nFor comparison, this is what I ended up with:\n\nAlthough these two admittedly look deceivingly similar, I regret to remind you that\nI dropped the project at a very early \"proof of concept\" stage, meaning that it is\nvery much lacking a lot of features and configuration options, some of which would\ncause certain issues in your tests.\nThis project was more about seeing if something similar to this was even possible\nrather than creating a useful library I'm afraid.\nThat said, there's some interesting bit of reflection involved which not too many\npeople care enough about so you might still find it interesting!\nHow Did This Start?\nA friend of mine recently started working on his own Fuzzer\nwhich can be found here, go give it a star!\nThe idea is simple: Create certain blueprint classes (he called them Reference classes)\nwhich\nFor example, the following method would generate and print 100 random URIs;\n\nMe being me, I started thinking about how this would work in the context of a library.\nHaving used Jqwik in the past, I liked their idea of defining\nProviders which were functions that would leverage the library and generate\nrandom output with potential useful constraints.\nFor instance, here's an example they include in their docs;\n\nThis deviates a bit from what I wanted to do but at the same time, it's not like\nI had a very clear image of what I wanted to achieve in the first place.\nWhat Did I Want To Build?\nIn my case, it would make more sense to have a let's say intProvider\nor a UriProvider instead of a intThatIsDivisibleBy3, although it would be nice to\nallow the tester to override an intProvider with a intThatIsDivisibleBy3 in a specific\ntest because why not, which is ironic for me to say considering the aforementioned feature\nis left as an exercise to the reader.\nI instead decided to go for simple data type providers and use those to build up any complex\ntype. In the Person example from the beginning of the post, for example, I defined UUID and\nString providers (or generators as I ended up calling them) in separate files and used those\nbehind the scenes to create a Person instance.\nMy idea was to worry about how this could look as a library rather than how the generation\nitself would work which is why as you will see I didn't really add any features around it.\nEnd Result?\nI'm pretty happy with how this ended up looking. Most of this is taken from my repo's\nREADME.\nFor this example, let's create a Person record which we'll try to generate automatically\nlater:\n\nThis class has 2 different classes in its fields, namely a UUID and a String so let's\ncreate Generators for both of them:\n\nThe contents themselves are not important for the sake of the example, hence the \"Random String\".\nHeading back to our Main method, running the following piece of code\n\nWould print something like this:\n\nI mentioned my friend's Fuzzer earlier as, if that was\nalso a library, we could use the Reference classes provided by it for our generators to very easily\nproduce complex and randomised attributes for our tests.\nThe Plan\nReiterating the previous paragraph but more concretely this time;\nThe plan is to fulfill the following:\n\neasily define a generator for a given data type\nregister generators manually (and potentially override default)\nhave a way to \"discover\" the generators automatically without the tester\nneeding to manually write them out one by one\nhave a very simple way of generating new classes\n\nGetting Started with the Generator\n\nWhy does Java have Type Erasure? :(\n\nThis right here was the main reason why I wanted to give this project a shot again.\nJava implements Type Erasure.\nHaving picked up reflection and Metaprogramming in general from C#, this was weird to me initially.\nWell, turns out that Java doesn't like reflection as much as C# does and this is terribly apparent in\nany framework/library comparison between the 2 languages.\nBut I'm getting sidetracked here. Type erasure is a pretty big problem for this project. To fully\nunderstand why I'll explain how I would be implementing this in a language that does not use\ntype erasure (say C#). I'll be using pseudo-ish code so don't take it char by char for this example.\nIt would be possible to have a map (or dictionary depending on your language) of type\n&lt;Class&lt;T&gt;, Callable&lt;T&gt;&gt; where we are essentially mapping a class to some function that\ngenerates an instance of that class. Sounds simple enough right? Well since that T would get\nerased at runtime, we'd have no way of using our map as it would essentially get turned into\n&lt;Class, Callable&gt;. This would make many things easier (and safer) but since it's not available\nwe'll go with the next best thing: using the class' string representation as the Key.\nSince we got that explanation out of the way, let's see how we could create our Generator class then\n\nPretty simple so far, we have a class of some generic type T that also has a method call that\nreturns something of that type T. I wanted both the class itself and the call method to be abstract\nso that concrete generators inherit from a class which will be important later when we try to detect\nthem.\nComing back to the example from earlier, if we wanted a StringGenerator then that would be a\nGenerator&lt;String&gt; type and call would return a String.\nUnfortunately, with Java being Java, getting that T is somewhat cumbersome so we'll add a\nmethod to help us with that here\n\nCalling this getType method on our StringGenerator would return java.lang.String.\nNotice that call is declared public so that it can be overridden by the tester while\ngetType is both final (so it can't be overridden) and also package-private.\nTo recap, we somewhat found a way around Java's type erasure using the text representation of the\nclasses instead of the classes themselves and we also made a wrapper abstract class to use for this.\nNow, all we have to do is literally everything else!\nCreating the Fixture Class\nSecond step into the project and here comes the first decision I later regretted: turning this class\ninto a Singleton.\nTest runners nowadays (JUnit included) play around with state scope a lot when running your tests.\nYour tests might be ran in parallel, certain objects involved in your tests might get an instance\nassigned to them for one single test or a group of tests, and so on. All these are usually fine\nif you are dealing with non-static classes. The pitfall of using static classes is that any\nchange in the underlying configuration options that you provide might produce unexpected\nbehavior if it takes place halfway through your test execution.\nYou will see later as I dive through my code that I have a ConstructorFinder interface, this is\nusing the strategy pattern to abstract away how I choose a class constructor (I could either pick\nthe one with the most attributes or the default one for example). I made this because, depending on\nyour use case, you might want to configure your class attributes through the constructor instead of the\nsetters or the other way around and I wanted the tester to be able to choose. This would be fine if\nyou could choose this option in an individual Fixture instance instead of a singleton. You should\ngenerally try to avoid anything static in your tests and this is exactly why.\nAs an example, say that all of the entities you use in your tests have full arg constructors\nwhich you want to use when instantiating them, except for this one class which for some reason\nuses a no-arg constructor only for which you need to use the setters for. Were you to tell my\nfixture class \"Hey, I want to use the no-arg constructor for this test\" the class would do that\nand also use that behavior for all the remaining tests which is more than likely, undesirable.\nDon't get me wrong, using a singleton somewhere is a good idea for this unless you want every\nnew Fixture instance to rescan half your package hierarchy. What I should have done instead however\nis have the Singleton be some sort of configuration/builder object that would create the actual\nFixture instance which would not be a singleton. This way, the state would not be shared between tests\nand that would not cause issues.\n\nWith that out of the way, let's see what my Fixture class looks like.\n\nNothing weird going on with the map as I explained my reasoning earlier. Let's go on a small tangent\nand check the ConstructorFinder class before moving further down\n\nSimilar to the Generator class from earlier, the idea is to, given a class T, return a\nconstructor with generic type T which means a constructor that creates an instance of T.\nAs I mentioned earlier, I made 2 implementations of this interface as seen below:\n\nThese definitely look safe and don't have half a dozen things that could go wrong in a more\nrealistic code base so let's move on!\nSmall note here, currently the map allows overrides; if a specific Generator exists and is registered\nat runtime, nothing is preventing you from specifying another Generator for the same type, effectively\noverriding the previous one. This isn't necessarily bad as you may want to make that override for a\nparticular test (assuming again, the concerns I listed earlier about singletons are taken care of)\nwhich would look like this;\n\nAnd another small note, I have moved some of these methods to a helper class Util to declutter\nthe original one, I'll be adding the filename at the top to avoid confusion!\nI've also defined a Tuple class which looks like this:\n\nDealing with the Generators\nAs I mentioned earlier, I wanted a way to dynamically find all the declared generators and\nuse them without the user needing to specify them.\nTo do that we first need to get all classes in the relevant package. I decided to consider\nthe \"relevant package\" to be the package that calls the registerGenerators (which is the\nmethod that we are building up to). A nice addition here would be to include a configuration\noption (or a function overload) that allows the tester to specify the package where the generators\nare defined to save up some time on startup and to allow them to specify a different package.\nAnyway, this is the method I ended up with\n\nWe first need to get the resource stream of the passed package which might be null if there's nothing\nleft, in which case we return an empty list. If not, we turn that into a list and iterate through it.\nClasses do end in .class so we can easily filter those out and add them to the result list (res) along\nwith the full package name so far. If the current element is not a class (and is, therefore, a package)\nwe recursively call the same method again only with an updated package name. Finally, we return the list.\nBut where does this packageName initially come from? The following method retrieves it\n\nThis is quite self-explanatory except for the stack trace stuff, what's that all about? This was\nborrowed from this StackOverflow post. Instead of\nthe 2, I am using 3 since this get's called from inside another method which adds another\nentry to the stack.\nMoving back to the Util class, I also made a small wrapper method to get the class given the path to it\nwhich is the following;\n\nNothing interesting happening here, just including it to avoid confusion later.\nFinally, we get to the more interesting stuff. Combining the previous methods together,\nwe get the following:\n\nUsing the list generated from the listAllClassesFromPackage, we have a sanity check filter\nfor the classes followed by a map that uses the getClass method I just mentioned. Now that\nwe have a stream of Classes we can check to see if they inherit from Generator. Now, for some\nreason I did not figure out, that would also include the Main class which is why I also make sure\nthat the current class does not have the Main method.\nLet's recap really quick because that is a lot to take in;\n\nwe have a way of getting the package name of the file that called a specific method we made\nwe also have a way to scan that package for all classes that inherit from the Generator class we\ncreated earlier\n\nThis means that we can now finally build the registerGenerators method!\nThis method had way too many exceptions to catch so let's look at it without the try-catch\nblocks first;\n\nWell that seems simple! We call findAllGenerators with the relevant package name and then\nfor each class in the resulting list, we call the Register method you can see right after\nwhich just adds them to the Fixture HashMap.\nThe real method looks more like this\n\nIt is worth noting that you should probably break this logic and error-catching down as this is\nway too many try-catches for one method but oh well, not my problem, if it works, it works eh?\nGenerating Class Instances\nNow that we have a way to dynamically find the declared generators and add them to our\n&lt;dataType, Generator&gt; map, it is time we start generating some class instances.\nI'll take this backward this time and show you the finished method before the parts that make it up\nbecause I want you to see how simple it actually was\n\nThat's it! We want to get a constructor of the provided class (using our strategy from earlier),\ncreate a new instance using that constructor (this uses our generators behind the scenes)\nand finally (technically also optionally), use our generators on all relevant setters.\nTechnically speaking, if this was an actual library you would want to let the tester decide whether\nor not you should use either the constructor, the setters or both. Perhaps this decision should be\nconnected to the constructor finder strategy as in, default constructor &amp; setters or\nbig constructor and no setters. In any case, that is beyond the scope of what I wanted to achieve\nso I didn't do much with it.\nBut enough with that, let's take a look at the getConstructorParams method;\n\nFor this, we want to basically do the exact opposite of what the Register method from\nearlier does; get the type class names, retrieve and call their corresponding Generators from our\nmap.\nWith all this done, we have now created our class instance! As I mentioned earlier, stopping here\nwould be fine (especially if we assumed that an all-arg constructor is always present) but as I\nmentioned earlier, I wanted to fiddle around with setters as well so let's now take a look at\nuseSetters;\n\nThis first creates a map of all the class field names and types which we'll use later.\nIt then finds all methods that contain \"set\" in their method name (so hopefully all setters).\nThen for each field, we try to find a setter that contains the field name in its name and if\nwe do find it we try and get a generator for the current field through our map. Finally, we\ninvoke the setter with whatever the generator call gives us.\nClosing\nAll in all, I'm glad I have this idea a shot again. I tried one or two more times in the past\nbut got stuck somewhere and dropped the project in favor of something else (preferably not Java)\nso it was definitely refreshing paying this a visit again after getting some new ideas from here\nand there.\nThis definitely was one way of spending the last 2 afternoons.\nTill next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/budget_fixture/","title":"BudgetFixture"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/cs_elk/":{"body":"What is the ELK stack?\nWith today's applications growing in complexity rapidly, debugging and efficiently digesting logs have become crucial.\nThat is the problem that the ELK stack is trying to solve.\nThe ELK stack consists of:\n\nElasticsearch: A distributed search engine with highly refined analytics capabilities\nLogstash: A data-processing pipeline that collects data and delivers it to Elasticsearch\nKibana: A visualization platform built expressly for Elasticsearch\n\nThese three together make for a great way of digesting aggregated logs from your application through visualizations.\nWhat will we be creating?\nWe will be making a simple API (the default weather forecast template), have it produce logs using Serilog into elasticsearch and viewing them\nthrough kibana.\nFor this post I will be assuming you have used C## before and thus you have a ready-to-go set up on your machine.\nCoding\nLet's first make our project using the dotnet cli, I will name mine elk\n\nVerify that everything is working fine by running the API\n\nand visiting https://localhost:5001/weatherforecast. I am using Insomnia for my http client but Postman or your browser\nwould also work.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nSetting up middleware\nI will be setting up middleware to handle logging as it is a cleaner solution than logging in each request. You can read more about middleware\nhere.\nI created the following file:\n\nand added the following line to the Configure method in Startup.cs\n\nIf we now run the app and make a request to our endpoint we can see Hello from middleware logged to the console.\nKnowing that that works lets change the middleware a bit so it can catch and handle exceptions\n\nIf we now run the app again we should see nothing logged in the console. If we add a throw new Exception(); statement in our controller\nwe should get a 500 Response back saying that an exception occurred and also see the exception logged in the terminal.\nI am going to add the following to the controller so we get errors at random from the endpoint\n\nSetting up the Elasticsearch and Kibana containers\nI will be using Docker to run Elasticsearch and Kibana so first thing I want to do is make a docker-compose.yml file.\n\nA few things about this;\n\nIt seems that at the time of writing this, version 3 does not support resource limits without using swarm hence the downgrade to 2.4\n(please use resource limits if you want your computer to be usable)\nThe cluster.initial_master_nodes and node.name must have the same value as I want to use a one node cluster\nThe ELASTICSEARCH_URL and ELASTICSEARCH_HOSTS params are needed since by default these will try to find the elasticsearch server at\nhttp://localhost:9200.\n\nSetting up Serilog\nWe will be using the Serilog.AspNetCore (for logging), Serilog.Sinks.Elasticsearch (for pushing our logs to elastic) and\nSerilog.Enricher.Environment (for adding properties from System.Environment) packages.\nOnce you have those installed, go to the appsettings.json file, remove the Logging section and add the following:\n\nWe need to make some changes in our Program.cs file both for logging in the terminal as well as pushing our logs to Elastic.\n\nMost of this you can find online but for as a short explanation:\n\nWe enrich our logs with the log context, machine name and the environment (dev/prod)\nWe push our logs both to the console and to elastic\nThe logs in elastic will have the format appname-dev/prod_date. Something to keep in mind for this is that it looks like some characters\nlike : do not work in these patterns or at least didn't work for me hence the underscore.\n\nWhat's cool about this is that we do not have to change our existing logger related code! We can also however use Serilog directly:\n\nChange the using Microsoft.Extensions.Logging; import to using Serilog;\nRemove the generic from the ILoggers\nChange _logger.LogError to _logger.Error\n\nAnother thing we can do is edit the Exception data and log some debugging critical parameter.\n\n\nIf we now run the app logs will start getting pushed to elastic (make sure to also make a few requests so you get some errors!).\nKibana\nWe can now visit http://localhost:5601 to access kibana.\nOnce there, go to Spaces &gt; Manage Spaces from the top right and select default. On the left you should see Index patterns and if you go there\nyou can essentially define the log pattern that you want kibana to consider, in my case that is elk-development_*. We can then go to\nAnalytics &gt; Discover and voilà!\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nIf you made the Exception data change mentioned earlier you should be able to see that as well\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThe true power of this comes from how you can query your logs. You could for example query for level: Error to get all your error logs\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nYou could also make queries like fields.ElapsedMilliseconds &gt; 10 or fields.RequestPath: /weatherforecast, you can read more about the\npossible queries here.\nOne thing I always love spending way too much time on is visualizations and I can definitely see this being the most powerful feature in\nKibana\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nConclusion\nOverall I think this was a pretty cool learning experience for me as I had never done proper error handling or used middleware before in\nC## (or used docker hardware limits but we do not talk about that). I think that although I definitely see the ELK stack being invaluable\nto a big company, I feel like I will not be using or recommend others to use if for small or personal projects as it is relatively hard\nto set up locally and expensive to host (especially if before this you just had a single app instance running).\nLong story short; it is definitely pretty cool but like normal logging should be enough for the majority of cases 👍.\nAnd of course by no means will implementing all of this compensate for bad error handling.\nThanks for reading!\nYou can find the code here.\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/cs_elk/","title":"C# and the ELK stack"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/efficient-logging/":{"body":"Introduction\nI've been using this neat command line tool called ouch. At its core, it doesn't do anything\ngroundbreaking but it is quite convenient; it gives you a unified and easy-to-use interface for\n(de)compressing just about any format you (or at least I) can think of.\nHere are some of the usage examples from the readme to get an idea of what it looks like:\n\nAnd similarly for compressing:\n\nAs you can see, it just works™ as you'd expect. The org does not have a sponsorship option so I\ninstead decided to keep an eye out for issues I could help with since I was using ouch on a\nweekly basis anyway.\nThe Problem\nSoon enough, I came across the following issue:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\n\nAll images of GitHub issues have hyperlinks to the actual issue so if you want to go ahead and\nread the issue on GitHub and escape my webp file compression, you can just click it!\n\nYou may notice that the issue is actually quite old by now. From what I understand in retrospect\n(as I was not using the project at the time), it was deemed to be not too important back then.\nThe problem resurfaced later when\nparallelism was added to decompression.\nThis caused 2 problems:\n\n\nPerformance: Having more than 1 thread fighting for printing info to the terminal caused dramatic\nslow-downs. In the example benchmark I used for my testing (more on this later), I found that in\nsome cases, decompressing 2 files in parallel that individually took ~31 seconds each, took\n49 seconds combined instead. That is an enormous increase as we'll see later.\n\n\nBroke ouch's questions about file overwriting: ouch would ask the user y/n questions when\na file was about to be overwritten by the now decompressed file. The logs would come out of order\nand often, more than 1 question would be printed before waiting for user input. That would look\nsomething like this:\n\nWhen obviously we would want to wait after each question individually. This happened because\nthere was no synchronisation happening between threads and it was down to luck whether\na 2nd thread would print anything between the first thread printing a question and locking stdout\nto wait for user input.\n\n\nBoth of these are quite common issues that arise when introducing parallelism as an afterthought to\na project. It is often very hard to anticipate what might go wrong when you make things run in\nparallel.\n\nJust as a side note here. This blog post focuses on an interesting performance problem, and\nthere's 2 groups of people that might come across this post:\n\nthose that have come across the problem before, to whom it must now feel quite trivial to\nsolve (at least in theory)\nthose that have not come across the problem before and are likely to be surprised by how much\nof a speedup a different logging strategy can offer (as well as how complex it is actually\nimplementing it)\n\nIf you are in the first category, you'll likely not find this too interesting as I am mostly\nwriting this for the 2nd group.\n\nThe Problem In More Detail\nPerformance\nThe performance decrease is rather simple; when you print something out to your terminal, you must\nlock stdout (or stderr). This can cause various\nproblems\n\nFor one, locking stdout (and later, flushing) is not instantaneous, they take time that adds up\nLocking stdout repeatedly (say in a for loop) can compound this effect\nLocking stdout repeatedly from different threads at the same time can further compound this effect\n(as well as mess with the order of prints as we'll talk about later).\n\nThe last 2 points are the result of lock contention.\nHow can we combat this? Simple! Just don't lock stdout all the time! (duh?)\nBut jokes aside that is how you actually combat this, this is formally called IO Buffering.\nInstead of constantly locking stdout whenever you produce a log message, you could instead put that\nlog message in a vector for instance and only print the vector when it reaches a certain size, at\nwhich point you clear the vector and repeat.\nThis makes logging dramatically faster. You can play around with your buffer size to see what works\nbest for you, in my case I ended up using a size of 16 log messages.\nThis approach introduces another subtle problem however, what if you produce less logs in the\nentire lifetime of your program than your buffer size? Well as of now, the logs would never be\nprinted! To fix that I took 2 approaches:\n\nThe obvious one is to make sure you always flush your buffer just before exiting the program.\nThis ensures that any remaining logs are always printed before your program terminates.\nAnother idea (used in conjunction with the first one) is to also flush every n milliseconds.\nWhile this does not at first glance, achieve anything that the first point does not, we must\nremember that logs can often be useful as real-time feedback to users! If nothing is being logged\nwhile work is being done, the user might think that the program is stuck! For this reason, in my\nimplementation, I also print the logs every 250ms, regardless of whether my buffer is full or not.\n\nBlocking Work Is Bad Actually\nAnother interesting issue that arises is that, while significantly reduced by now, the time spent\nlocking stdout, flushing and clearing our buffer is time our main program completely halts all work\nand does nothing until the logs are printed.\nThe solution to this is quite simple in principle but can be rather complicated and/or tedious at\nbest to implement given your programming language of choice: we need to run our log printing on a\nseparate thread! This makes it so our real work is no longer paused at all since buffering a log\nmessage is just a vector insertion (which for all intents and purposes is instant) and printing it\nnow happens on a separate thread.\nThis can require a decent refactoring of your code and you must of course ensure that all prints\nuse your logger instead of interacting with stdout directly, otherwise, all of this is mostly\nuseless.\n\nIn Rust, you could use\nclippy lints to deny usage\nof println!s!\n\nEnsuring that data can be sent safely across threads is also crucial here, in Rust this is a\ntextbook application of channels.\nOut-of-Order Issue\nBecause of the way that ouch works, we figured that simply locking stdout and stdin in the\nworker thread that needs to ask whether the user wants to overwrite the file was a viable solution.\n\nWe had briefly considered doing this blocking in the logger thread but the addition of bidirectional\ncommunication that would be needed for this between the logger thread and the worker thread (we\nwould need to somehow tell the worker whether the user said yes or no) would significantly\novercomplicate the code so we decided against it.\n\nThis is because the worker thread needs to pause its work to wait for user input anyway, we can't\nkeep working in the background while waiting for user input so this does not worsen performance.\nWhile this is happening, other worker threads that do not require user input can keep sending their\nlogs to the logger thread undisturbed. The logging thread will of course be unable to interleave\nits logs with our y/n overwrite question since we already took the stdout lock in the thread that\nneeded user input.\nThis part here deserves attention as, depending on the specifics of your implementation, it might\nbe that logs can be lost here; If you need to be waiting for a log message from other threads to\nadd to your buffer but your logger thread code is stuck trying to acquire the stdout lock, new\nlogs could be lost. With Rust channels, this is not a problem as messages are buffered internally\nwhich means we can just receive them later.\nThis is a bit hard to convey with words so I'll try and clarify it with some pseudo-code.\n\nNotice how there is a chance that buffer.is_full() is true but we can't execute flush(buffer)\nif the lock for stdout is already held elsewhere. Depending on how your channel works, this can\ndisregard new messages so it is something to be aware of (again, with Rust channels this does not\nhappen).\nPutting It All Together\nI ended up creating a ✨technical diagram✨ to convey the overall picture better than my writing\ncould.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nAs you can see, we have n worker threads spawned by main (1 for each input file in our case) as\nwell as a separate logging thread. All log messages produced by the worker threads are sent\nto the logging thread which buffers them and prints them according to the approaches we mentioned\nearlier. And any time we need user input, the worker thread locks stdin and stdout itself.\nBut how much faster was it really? Well here are the results of the benchmark I used in my pull\nrequest:\n\n\nBefore:\nFiles to extractTime\nboth49.9s\ntest1/test231.4s/31.2s\n\n\n\nAfter:\nFiles to extractTime\nboth16.7s\ntest1/test212.9s/11.3s\n\n\n\n\nQuite the difference!\nJust to explain the benchmark a bit more, as well as the \"my cherry-picked-definitely-representative\nbenchmark!\" comment from this post's description.\nThe benchmark from what I remember (I slacked for like 4 months before blogging about this) was as\nfollows:\n\ncompress ouch's repository into a zip test1.zip\ncopy test1.zip into test2.zip to get 2 identical zip files\ndecompress them both individually as well as in parallel and measure the time taken\n\n\"Well, how is this not representative!?!?!?\" I hear you ask. Well, the majority of ouchs logs are\nsomething like file x has been extracted. This means that decompressing a full repository\nincluding .git and the target directory will produce a lot of logs since there are a lot of\nfiles.\nFor reference, after generating a debug and release build, I seem to have just shy of 3.5k files.\nOf course, my comment about representativeness is rather exaggerated; it really depends on what\nyou use ouch for. If you decompress large, single files then these changes will likely make\nno perceivable difference whatsoever to you. But if your archives have a decent amount of files\nin them then this is quite the improvement.\n\nYou can check the full PR here.\n\nWrapping Up\nOverall, this was my proudest OSS contribution so far. It was an interesting, performance problem in\na big (and daunting), unknown Rust code base of a tool that I use frequently, ticked a lot of boxes!\nIt was nice weighing the pros and cons of different approaches with Marcos, the (main?) maintainer\nof ouch. And even though he MISCREDITED the WRONG PERSON in\nhis issue because I guess we have similar names?\nor something??? (unforgivable), I forgive him because he was really nice to talk to while slamming\nmy head against a wall trying to work this stuff out (he was seriously nice, go give ouch a star\nif it seems like something you'd use).\nBut yeah. It was a nice boost mentally to learn that I can just jump into an unfamiliar project\nand solve non-trivial issues. 10/10 would recommend.\nTill next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/efficient-logging/","title":"Efficient Logging"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/finding_rust_crates/":{"body":"Introduction\nA common complaint from Rust beginners is:\n\n\"The main issue is just communicating currently suggested libraries.\"\n\nI feel like most people that have been actively using Rust for a few months likely don't suffer from\nthis as they learn their way around the ecosystem but I also feel like most people would agree that\nthis is a problem for beginners. This is more so the case in Rust than most other languages because\nthe standard library does not implement a lot of the things that you'd expect it to, coming from\nother languages. While this does have very valid reasons to be the case, it just makes the life\nof a beginner harder.\nThe Basics\nI am going to mention a few crates that are so \"basic/common sense\" if I can call it that, that\nyou might have issues looking for with the methods I'll list later. By \"basic/common sense\"\nI definitely do not mean simple to implement as you'll see soon, just things that you would most\nlikely not look for in a different language.\nAsync Runtimes\nYes, that's right, Rust does not come with its own async runtime! There are multiple reasons for\nthis, the simplest being that not all runtime strategies are created equal;\nSome are great for high-performance file I/O, some are focused on distributed systems, some are\ntargeting embedded devices and some are built to be as general-purpose as possible.\nFor the vast majority of cases, you'll want to use Tokio. Some other available\noptions include Bastion, async-std,\nEmbassy and Glommio.\nYou can read more\nhere.\nError Handling\nRust's error handling can get verbose sometimes, which is exactly why there are a bunch of crates\nthat can help you with that.\nFor library code, thiserror is often used whilst for\nuser-friendly errors, anyhow and\nmiette are common. Of course, if you are working on a project\nthat has both a library component as well as a binary one, you can definitely use both anyhow and\nthiserror/miette very easily.\nTesting\nWhile Rust does provide you with a few ways to write assertions (you can write just about anything\nwith a combination of assert!,\nassert_eq! and\nmatches!), people coming from languages\nlike Java or C# might find\nassertables or\nspectral useful.\nThere's also pretty-assertions\nfor more readable outputs and static-assertions\nfor compile-time assertions.\nFinding Crates\nIf you already vaguely know what you're looking for, I'd recommend the following steps in order:\n\nTry and search for the thing you are looking for on GitHub (remember to filter by programming\nlanguage!). I find GitHub's search to be quite good at this and I usually find what I need\nrather quickly. I also like checking the number of stars the project has along with the number\nof issues and when the last commits were made before using a crate which I can of course see\nimmediately this way.\nTake a look at crates.io (or lib.rs) and try to make\nuse of the crate categories. For instance, say you are looking for parsers, you can query\nthis (or this)\nto find the most commonly used crates of that category.\nJust google it. If you haven't found what you need yet (and hopefully after you tried\na few query variations already), you can try plain old Googling (or DuckDuckGoing I guess).\nThis has the added benefit of going through blog and forum posts on top of GitHub, crates.io etc.\nJust prefix your search term with rust and see what you get.\nIf all else fails, just ask the community! I left this for last as it usually takes more time\nthan typing 4 words in a search bar but it definitely works! There's\nDiscord servers\nforums,\nSubreddits and\nZulip chats (again in the order I'd use them) where you can\nask for help from other people.\n\n\nFor example, recently I got a few ideas that required me to use a\nFinite-state transducer which I would say\nis relatively niche for Rust at least. I instinctively searched for finite state transducer on\nGitHub, filtered for Rust repositories and very quickly found\nfst.\n\nCommunity Curated Lists of Crates\nThere exist curated lists of crates such as blessed.rs and\nawesome-rust.\nThere's also numerous websites in the form of arewe___yet which include crates and information\non resources targeted at a particular field (for instance\narewewebyet.org) which unsurprisingly mentions the most common\ncrates one would use for a web project. You can find a list of this type of websites in\nthis GitHub repository.\nDiscovering Crates\nThere are a few ways to passively discover interesting crates without actively looking for them.\nOne that I enjoy a lot is This week's in Rust's section called\n\"Crate of the Week\". You can often find people making posts in the\nRust subreddit when they come up with cool ideas and the same goes\nfor channels like #showcase in the\nRust community Discord server.\nThere's also Rustacean Station which is a nice podcast that often\nfeatures some very interesting people. You can find their episodes on Spotify for sure and likely\nmost other big podcast platforms.\nClosing\nThis is the first post I've made that is not just me walking through the last project I just\nfinished working on but hopefully, you still learned something from this!

So much so that\neven time complexity ends up being a useless metric in some cases.\nIt is worth pointing out that time complexity is a measure of how well an algorithm scales rather\nthan how fast it is but we'll see that even that can be misrepresentative of the actual performance\nof two algorithms.\nThe Problem\nWe will focus on element deletions (additions would work the same way) at different points of the\nlinked list and vector data structures.\nIf you recall from your Algorithms &amp; Data Structures class, deleting the ith element requires a\ntraversal up to i-1 and then changing its pointer to point to i+1 instead of i, effectively\ndeleting it. In contrast, because vectors use contigious memory, they need to be copied to a new\nlocation in memory without the item that we want to delete.\nIf you had asked me which of the two would end up being faster, before today I would've answered\n\"Well linked lists of course! I know memory is slow and copying an entire array sounds expensive!\".\nAs it turns out however, that tends to not be the case!\nWhat ends up happening is that the cost of traversing the data structure to find the element we are\nlooking for completely overshadows the copying costs that arrays come with!\nWriting the boilerplate\nWe will start by creating a linked list and a vector.\nIn Rust we have the LinkedList\nstruct which is a doubly-linked list and Vec\nwhich is a contiguous growable array.\nI made a simple helper method for generating a LinkedList and a Vec of the same size:\n\nThen I made just 2 methods, each for removing the ith element of the passed list/vec respectively:\n\nRust's explicitness over things like cloning is one of the things I really like about it as it makes\nspotting potentially costly operations really easy and it forces you to think about them. At least\nwhen I contrast it to something like Java or Python which is what I've worked with mostly, I'm sure\nC++ works much the same way as Rust (or any other lower level lang for that matter).\nWriting the benchmarks\nFor the benchmarks I will use Criterion.\nI want to benchmark the following scenarios for a few different list/vec sizes:\n\nremoving the first element\nremoving the middle element\nremoving the element at size/4\nremoving the element at 3*(size/4)\nremoving a random element\n\nIntuitively, the earlier the element appears in the sequence, the faster Linked Lists should be as\nthey have to traverse fewer elements. But there is also the size of the data itself to consider as\nbehavior might change for small or very large inputs.\nI decided to use\n\nfor the different data sizes. The full code is available here but I'll briefly go over\nthe random element benchmark code here. These are all largely the same.\n\nIf you've written (Criterion) benchmarks before, this should all be pretty self explanatory. Perhaps\nthe only thing to note here would be the bench_with_input method. I use that instead of just bench\nbecause it takes 2 closures, one of which is not measured and is used to generate the test data\n(vec.clone() in my case). Doing this makes it so we do not include the cost of cloning in our\nmeasurements.\nThe Results\nLet's start by comparing the removal of the first element:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nAs we can see, list does expectedly scale in constant time, while list appears more linear. Nothing\nweird so far but it is all downhill for the linkedlist from here.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nWe are only 1/4th of the way into the data and already vectors are outperforming lists. Going\nto the middle only exaggerates the issue further while remaining roughly the same for the vector;\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nIf we remove the 3/4th element, we see that performance becomes very comparable to the first plot again:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nThis is because as I mentioned earlier, Rust's Linked List is doubly linked and the remove method\nchecks to see which side it should iterate from. Smart!\nFinally (and perhaps the more useful) benchmark; removing random elements:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nWe can see that they are a bit closer this time but still the vector does quite a bit better and they\nwould only diverge further for larger inputs. Depending on what you're doing, 10k elements might be\nunreasonably small for in real life the difference could be much bigger.\nThis is also the only case where lists were actually faster for the smallest inputs although at that\npoint of course you hardly care about the difference, it is more interesting than useful.\nAnother thing to consider that is often critical is how predictable the performance is:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nWe can see that for the largest input, the vector's distribution is significantly tighter compared\nto the list. This is to be expected; the performance of lists depends on where exactly the element\nis (slowest in the middle, fastest on either end) while vectors don't care.\nAs a final benchmark I decided to repeatedly randomly remove elements until half of them remain.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nWoah that is very close. I was not really expecting that. I am not entirely sure why that is but\nI am guessing it has to do with the fact that the more elements we remove, the more favored lists\nbecome since they have to iterate less and less. Still quite interesting! If we use 100k as an\ninput size as well however they diverge quite a bit:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nVectors are twice as fast at this point. Goes to show that depending on your use case, you might get\nslightly different results. That said at no point in my tests were vectors slower and of course all\nthese tests are their weaknesses so I don't see when you would want to use linked lists over them.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nJust as before, the distribution of the vector is a bit more packed than that of the list.\nClosing\nThis was for sure one way to spend one of my afternoons.\nAbout a day or two after I made this post I came up with 2 questions that I may or may not try to\nanswer in the future if I am not too lazy;\n\nWould lists suffer even more in a garbage collected language? Maybe the fact that more garbage\nwould need to be deleted (many list nodes vs 1 array) would slow things down even further. I do\nnot know enough about the specifics of garbage collector implementations to guess if this would\nbe the case so I'd have to do benchmarks in Java or something but that sounds like effort.\nIn the repeated removal benchmark I was surprised that lists were faster for up to 10k elements\nand I speculated that it might be because the lists got smaller and smaller so the cost of them\nkept decreasing. A way to figure out if that is indeed the case would be to simply do insertions\ninstead of deletions (or both) and see if that reverses this trend or not. This would be simple to\ndo but I am rather busy at the moment so I will leave it for later.\n\nAs Mr Stroustrup said in his talk \"When I was taught about data structures, this [insertions/deletions]\nis what you used lists for!\" same for me and I assume most other people.\nIt was interesting to see how (at least nowadays) this seems to no longer be the case. I do wonder\nif the benchmarks would be different on older hardware and just how far back we would need to go to\npotentially reverse this trend.\nThis was a rather short post but oh well. I need to find more things to write about.\nIn any case, till next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/lists-and-vectors/","title":"Linkedlists kinda ..suck?"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/low-effort-everything/":{"body":"Introduction\nThis post will just be me ranting for a while about a bunch of different topics that have all\nbeen marinating in my mind for the better part of the last year or so.\nThere is not really a single thing this post is about as you're about to see, it's more so few\nunrelated topics that all share this \"lowest effort possible\" and cutting corners mentality, my\nfrustrations for which have been boiling up for a while but were hard to really put to words.\nLab Work for my University Course\nLet's start with what prompted this post.\nA Disclaimer\nLet's make a few things clear before I get into this. I will try to stray away from any specifics\nabout the course and assignment(s) I am going to talk about in this section. This is not meant to be\nan attack to any of the people involved directly, I believe the things that I am going to be\ncomplaining about are rather common and this is just an example I personally came across.\nI also understand that there likely are limitations imposed to those who worked on the course and\nassignment(s) that are unknown to me; whether that would be about the amount of time they have\navailable or something else entirely. I am no academic let alone professor, I am just a student that\nis passionate about software, this is why I am writing all of this in the first place.\nIt is near impossible to truly understand how hard and time consuming creating a course\nand its assignments must be, I certainly do not know much about that. Thus, understand that this\npost was written by an outsider; someone with no experience as a professor and even next to no\nprofessional experience in general. This is written purely out of love for my field and the\nfrustrations I've been having about some of its recent developments.\nTHAT SAID, will any of this prevent me from dumping my complaints here? No!\nThe First Assignment\nIt was more so the second assignment that prompted this post but a few relevant things can be said\nabout this one.\nI won't get into the specifics of what exactly we had to do in this assignment since it does not\nmatter for the points I want to make, all you need to know is we were given a codebase of 1 or 2\nthousand lines of Python code, and some very loose guidelines on what we had to do.\nThe assignment required us to experiment a lot with the code and try a bunch of ideas to see what\nworks and what makes sense. It was not a \"here's some code that partially works, finish it\" type of\nassignment, it was more like \"here's some code that already does something, we need you to come up\nwith ways of extending it\".\nThe best way to describe the codebase I think would be an extremely brittle and fragile blob.\nCombine that with how hard non-type hinted python is to work with and you've got a ✨mess✨.\nWhy am I dunking on the poor guy that had to code this up? Well because I just don't think he was\nproud of it himself either and I don't think he was to blame. The code felt very much thrown\ntogether and lacked cohesion in its design, things you often see when you have to rush to meet\na deadline. My question is why were the higher ups, whether that'd be professors or whoever else\nhappy with this and felt like using it for the assignment instead of just giving the guy a bit more\ntime to refine it or even have such refinements as a general requirement. If you tell people that\nit is important to pay attention to their code quality because other people will have to work on it,\nthey'll be conscious about it and program with that in mind.\n\nAnd just to be clear, I am not immune to this by any means. This is normal. I didn't have enough\ntime given the deadline to do things as I wanted so I had to move fast and hack things together.\nI get it. Saying I'm ashamed of how bad my code was would be a bit too strong a word but I for\nsure was not happy with it either. It worked but i wouldn't want to touch it again.\nWhat I'm trying to say is, its normal to write sloppy code when under tight time limits. I get\nwhy I, a student, have tight time limits, we need to finish the assignment at some point after all.\nWhat I don't get is why the people making the assignment could not just use some more time since\nthey clearly needed it.\nThey are not bound by having to start a few weeks before the deadline like the students do\nand there is nothing preventing them from working on the assignment code after the deadline\nhas passed. The assignment code was unchanged (and re-used) for multiple years, our course lasts\n2 months.\n\nI can already feel some people reading this thinking something along the lines of \"Oh so you want\nthem to make everything perfect for you? To make your life easier? They want to teach you how to work\nin such bad environments because that's often how workplaces are!\"\nThis is such a silly argument. Very convenient how it coincides perfectly with what you get from a\ncombination of laziness and neglect.\nThere's a difference between someone not laying all the ground work for you vs someone intentionally\ndoing a bad job to artificially make an assignment harder. Does one learn more from being forced to\nwork with subpar code in subpar environments? Probably. But immediately assuming the people behind\nthis are doing this intentionally for your own good is a quite the reach. It seems much more likely\nto me that they have other more interesting and important stuff to attend to, whether that'd be\ntheir own courses that they are taking or actual research and they thus pay little attention to this\nrandom assignment meant for Bachelor students.\nI understand that but this does not mean I can't believe they should do better!\nOn a side note, as I understand, it was just one guy worked on this assignment. I think it would've\nbeen an enormous help to him to have worked with at least one other person. These are things that\nyou need to consider as the person coordinating (I'm assuming the professor) the assignment creation,\nyou need to have some quality requirements and since you \"outsource\" the work to teaching assistants,\nyou need to figure out how to help them achieve your quality standards more easily. You take the role\nof a project manager somewhat, this shouldn't be a fire and forget process.\nI know I'd have a hard time getting something like that to work well first try but the goal should not\nbe to get it done as soon as possible; it should be to end up with something good. If that needs\nmore time than whatever you gave the TA then so be it.\nThe Second Assignment\nThis specifically was the last straw that led me to finally write about this because it pulled a\ncouple of things together for me.\nIn this assignment we had to create some agent that would do some stuff and the main way to evaluate\nhow good the agent was is to put him against the rest of the agents in a tournament. This tournament\nwas a 1-on-on-1 matchup between every pair of agents. In addition, each pair had I think 4\nrematches.\nIf you are a programmer, this should already be ringing alarms in your head.\nNow my math is a little rusty but I believe that this ends up being 2n(n−1) matchups for n=\nthe number of agents.\nThe problem is we had 32 agents to run, and that was already a subset, there were a lot more.\nThis amounts to 1984 matchups, each of which should take at most 10 seconds (+ some extra time\nto spin everything up which was not counted in these 10 seconds but lets ignore this for now).\nThat leaves us with a whopping 5 and a half hours needed to run this tournament on all 32 agents.\nThis is quite the problem as the assignment requires you to experiment a lot and there is not really\na way to confidently know what effect most of your changes are going to have without testing them.\nAnd since each one of those agents are different, testing on anything smaller than the full 32 agents\nmight give you an incomplete picture of the effectiveness of your changes.\nAnd to top all that off, randomness plays a non-negligible role in each matchup, meaning that after\nyou run the tournament, ideally you'd want to run it again a few times just to be sure it was not\na one-off lucky result.\nNow, again if you are a programmer, a few more alarms should be going off for you still; this is an\nEmbarrassingly parallel task. Do you want\nto guess that the performance improvement was from parallelizing this?\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nYou could say it was noticeable.\n\nThe very astute of you might've noticed that the single threaded version took 2 hours less than\nour previous estimate. This was down to two things; some agents just straight up crashing sometimes\n(which was quite funny to find, why was that allowed and handed to us? Did no one test this\nbeforehand??) and also many sessions ending before the 10 second time limit. It adds up fast.\nYou might've also noticed the green line labelled \"Safe multi threaded\" which was a bit slower\nthan the other multi threaded line. I lied to you earlier when I said that this problem was\nembarrassingly parallel, you see, a variable amount of agents make use of what we call memory;\nthey remember their previous sessions and adjust their behavior accordingly. This introduces a\ndependency in our tournament as for these agents to work properly, we need to make sure their\nsessions happen one at a time. However, very few (or even none) of the agents in the tournament make\nuse of this mechanism and as such, parallelizing everything else while all of the matchups of the\nmemory dependent agents run on one thread still gives a massive performance boost while maintaining\ncorrectness. Note that by default the only agent that can implement memory is your own and you\nmight choose not to do that so you may have none at all that use memory in the first place.\nThe point is; blue line very slow, the rest very fast.\nAnother note: Throughout this post when I mention \"Multi-threading\" I really mean\nMulti-processing as this was in Python\nand the GIL exists.\nApologies for the confusion but as you can tell I don't frequent Python :)\n\nBut then what's the problem? If it was so easy to do why complain about it? Well why was I the one\nthat had to make this change?\nI (and admittedly my team) are kinda lucky I like optimising stuff (something no course has paid any\nattention to, it is worth noting) and I was lucky I decided to take a look at the assignment and really\nunderstand it the day it was published. I did some napkin math to figure out that tournaments would take\nforever and I knew I wouldn't be able to stand that much wait time. I thankfully also realized that this\nseemed trivial to parallelize and that, it was.\nMy issue? This has nothing to do with the course and presumably the vast majority of the rest of the\ngroups in my class did not have this luxury, forcing them to wait a while longer for good results or\nforcing them to severely reduce their agent amount which hurts them with less representative results\nEither way, this is bad for no reason.\nI just don't get who in the right mind approved this. How do you think this is \"good enough\"? And funny\nthing is, its not just us that have to run this, course staff also has to, either with all the\nrepresentative agents + all our own I would imagine. If this was anything more complicated than\nliterally the simplest parallelization I've ever implemented, I'd understand. You may have needed\nsome specialized knowledge to achieve it I mean, concurrency can get notoriously tricky. But this\nwas trivial and I truly mean trivial. Wasting so many hours for everyone and why? Because no one\nthought \"you know maybe we should consider for 10 minutes whether we can improve this somehow\".\nThis is not me complaining because I had to spent time parallelizing this. Quite the opposite, I find\noptimizing things very fun and rewarding, in fact it was the cooler part of the assignment for me. I'm\npurely complaining because I find it unreasonable for the assignment boilerplate to not have this\nalready, considering it is completely unrelated to the scope of not only our course but our entire\nbachelor. We were not meant to do this ourselves.\nI understand that I did implement it because I am interested in this sort of stuff (performance) and\nbecause I likely have less on my plate. My point is that its the higher ups that are putting stuff\non these plates that should think about things like this more often.\n\nTo be clear, I think having no courses that focus on performance measuring and\noptimization (other than just looking at pure time complexity which we are taught) is a major\noversight that most university programmes I know fall to.\nI think this is a big mistake and that students should know at least some basics to avoid\nsituations like this but that is another discussion for another day.\n\nAt the time of writing this, the assignment deadline is in half a week and I have so far saved\nat least 3 days of runtime from all the tournaments I've ran so far. This will likely be about a\nfull week's worth of runtime by the end of the week since we have to gather a lot of tournament\ndata for evaluating our agent and writing a report.\nThat is a lot of time saved for next to no effort.\nAfter the deadline has passed, I'll attempt to contact the course staff and see if I can get\nmy parallelization approved and merged into the boilerplate, it would be great if at least the\nstudents taking this class in the future get to benefit from it!\n\nAn update on the last few paragraphs; the deadline of the assignment is now behind me and my new\nestimates about the time saved are around 2 weeks+ now, the last 2-3 days I was practically\nrunning tournaments non-stop while I was awake.\nI've also attempted to contact the course professors about potentially including my optimization\nto the assignment code but have not received a response yet. I'll keep updating this when/if\nthat changes in the future.\n\nThe Recent Overwhelming AI Slop Trends\nAs I sort of alluded to earlier, this is what I really wanted to talk about, not all the stuff\nabout my assignments that I mentioned above. The assignments helped me really put into words\nthis general annoyance I had about some of the recent AI trends and some online behavioral\nshifts I've been seeing in general.\nA Clarification Regarding Terminology\nAI is a very wide and deep field, so much so that it is exceedingly hard for any one person\nto have a good, in-depth understanding of all its facets. However, recently the word \"AI\" has\ntaken a much more reduced meaning in online conversations as it usually refers to mostly\ngenerative models.\n(sometimes abbreviated as GenAI). In the case of text generators, these largely end up referring to\nthe GPT family of models by OpenAI as for images or videos, there are a few more candidates.\nEven though this way of using the term \"AI\" is as I mentioned wildly reductive, considering how\nprevalent it has become over the last few years, I will be using it as such to avoid confusion\nwith any potentially non-technical readers of this post.\nThe Current State of the Internet\nI can't help but feel a sense of dread or repulsion, for lack of a better word, when I inevitably\ncome across AI related content anytime I go online these days. Whether that's low effort text to\nspeech videos with the same monotone annoying voice or low effort advertising for useless products\nor low effort \"art work\" that always has that glowy mushed look to it and always looks the same or\nstraight up scam ads made by bots showing fake content/images or sometimes generated videos of\nsometimes famous people telling you that you should definitely buy a lot of this new cryptocurrency\nbecause it's about to make you rich or articles that sure include a lot of words for\nthe exorbitant amount of nothing they actually talk about!\nIf you are particularly observant, you might have noticed a subtle reoccurring pattern in the\nexamples I mentioned.\nIt all looks the same, feels the same, is largely very low quality and because it requires little to\nno effort, is absolutely everywhere.\nThe kids call this AI Slop, and depending on what parts of\nthe internet you frequent, it may or may not look like it is taking over everything.\nAnd it sucks.\nAnother example of this is the\nDead Internet Theory; lots of social media\nnowadays really does feel like its just bots making generic posts, most of the replies to which\nare also random bots writing nonsense. This is so common that there are\nentire accounts dedicated to pointing this out.\nWhy Is It So Prevalent?\nHere's a thought experiment; imagine if you will, that you are a journalist. Your day job consists\nof writing article for a news website. You need to spend hours researching what you write about,\nfind an interesting, relevant topic, verify and include sources, structure your text in a way\nthat makes it easy to read and more things of that nature.\nAt the end of it all you end up with an article that the news website you work for takes and posts\non their platform. Since you put all that work in writing it, it is reasonable to expect at least a\nhandful of people to be intrigued enough by your title to click on it and read it. Which is great!\nNow the news website earns its money from the advertisements displayed to the readers and can\nafford to pay you. Life is good! You get paid, the website gets paid, and the reader reads something\ncool.\nNow imagine instead, that you are the owner of the website instead. Writers are expensive and take\ntime to write articles. What if someone came to you one day and told you that they have developed\nthis great new amazing tool that can write orders of magnitude more articles, at a fraction of the\ntime it would take your writers to write them, and it can also do it for cheaper.\nYou may think to yourself \"no way, that's way too good to be true!\" but you might also seriously\nconsider it. And I mean I wouldn't really blame you, sounds like a great deal.\nSo you try it.\nAnd oh my god its great.\nYou are in awe of how it spits out entire articles from very basic instructions. And it looks great\nI mean, no typos, no grammatical errors, it even adds its own images and references, sick!\nSo you start using it. Maybe you even replace your human work force with it, either partially or\nfully. You spend less money and post more articles.\nBut problems start to appear.\nSometimes your articles are completely incohesive. Sometimes they straight up lie and use fake\ncitations to back up their claims. Your images look ..weird.\nWhat is going on?? Well, it was too good to be true. The person selling it to you either forgot\nor severely undermined its flaws because those aren't good for making sales.\nOkay well that sucks but what now? You can't just go back I mean you are making more money! But fear\nnot, the new version of this tool is coming out soon and it will solve all the previous problems you\nhave! It will just be a bit more expensive, but it's worth it because it's sizably better and smarter!\nYou can guess how it goes from here.\nOverhype, Overpromise, Underdeliver\nOne of my biggest issues with AI in general over the last few years is just how much straight up\nlying has been involved in the advertising. Either directly, or indirectly.\nTake Devin, the AI software engineer that can code anything, just look at our\ntotally real and not faked demo! It would be so funny\nif the company behind Devin was valued at several hundred millions for a fake product that is, at\nbest, nowhere near as capable as nefariously advertised and, at worst, straight up intentionally\nmisleading.\nOh what's that? It is actually valued at 2 billion?\nOr maybe indirectly. How many times have you heard that \"this newer model addresses a lot of the\nissues of its predecessor!\". Only for newer models to often fall short, or have new issues that make\nworking with them worse. A recent example is Claude 3.7 which seems to be having a bunch of new\nannoying issues that were not present in 3.5 for instance. Another example is Meta being under fire\nearlier this week for\nallegedly artificially boosting their benchmarks for Llama 4.\n\nI see lots of stories like this brought up all the time. Granted, many of them can be deemed as\nanecdotal or unreliable. I encourage you to do your own research on the subject and draw your own\nconclusions, especially if you are a user of these models and their predecessors. You may find\nthat they work better for you, in which case great! I do not have personal experiences with the\nclaims I brought up earlier in this paragraph as I don't use AI much in programming in the first\nplace.\n\nHow many times have you heard that \"AI will replace programmers by next year\", because I've seen a\nmetric ton of these posts. Often suspiciously coming about right around the launch of some company's\nnew AI model or product, wonder why that is. And every time without fail, the post-hype results\nare underwhelming.\nI've lost track of the amount of times I've more or less seen something like the following tweet\nby now:\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n   \n\n\n\n\"AI will replace programmers! Your skills are obsolete, you should buy our product/service instead!\".\nEvery year it feels like this is echoed.\nI challenge you to go to your favorite search engine and see how many tweets you can find from each\nyear, repeating \"next year, we will achieve AI singularity for sure this time!\" while trying to sell\nyou something.\nI love how every few months you find an incredible startup idea. I remember once seeing a company\nbuilt around the idea of letting AI file your taxes.\nBro.\nI can't trust AI to write me a short email without hallucinating, and you want me to trust it with\nmy taxes? I don't understand this at all.\nWhat's even more hilarious is how many of these companies try to get non-technical\npeople to think they've made their \"own\" AI model, when they are really just what we call\nwrappers (services that just call another service\nthat does the work under the hood) for, more often than not, GPT models.\nProgrammers understand how little effort is needed to accomplish that, but it turns out that if you\nadvertise your product to your clients as if you made your own cool model from scratch and they\nbelieve you it makes you look more professional and serious and enterprise-y and that sells!\n\"What is the Cost of Lies\"\nA lot of my problems with how AI is at the moment is how it's presented. It has some serious\nflaws that can really hurt you if you're not aware and especially careful when using it. I like to\nbelieve that at least the majority of programmers know and understand this, but we are not the only\npeople that AI is being sold to.\nI am constantly shocked and reminded by how many people don't know how easy for current AI models\nto just confidently\nhallucinate information\nthat is just not real.\nSome Examples\nA nice relevant, personal example of this is my dad, who is a Doctor. At some point, he\nwas writing an article and decided to try throwing it to ChatGPT to see what it would give him back.\nHe was surprised by how nicely it rewrote some parts of the article, and just as he was about to share\nit with someone else for review, he thought of verifying the references the AI had added. They were\nhallucinated. Pointing to papers that did not exist, fabricated to support its writing. My dad\nhas since taken anything that comes out of AI with a grain of salt.\nAnother personal example is from a discussion I was having with Luciano Mammino,\na Senior Software Engineer and author of the WIP\nCrafting Lambda Functions in Rust book. Someone from his discord server\nasked for Rust technical interview prep questions and Luciano shared a website he had come across\nrecently at the time which looked interesting. I remember checking it out myself only to find that\na bunch of the code example it contained were plain invalid and would not even compile. The article\nrepeated itself many times and even when the code it presented compiled, still often carried errors:\n\nThis is part of a message I sent to Luciano:\n\"Theres also a couple of questions where the code that \"has a logical error\" seems to work and the\nsuggested answer is based on something that is not true? A question about palindromes towards the\nend of the page mentions that using .eq between 2 iterators\nis comparing two iterators, not the actual reversed string but the docs explicitly tell you that\nits an element wise comparison so they *are* comparing the actual reversed string. This sounds like\nsomething java would do instead xd\"\n\nIf that all was not enough, at one point the article literally mentioned:\nSure, here are the remaining four questions: which sounds exactly like what you'd expect an AI model\nto reply to something along the lines of Give me another 4 questions. I remember taking a quick\nlook at their Twitter page and finding out that their last posts was:\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n   \n\n\n\nJust about as ironic as it gets. Just to be clear, this is not at all a dig at Luciano who admitted\nthat he hadn't taken a proper look at their article. It just goes to show that issues like this\ncan slip past even experienced engineers and can seriously hurt less experienced ones who might\ntake them as the ground truth.\nOk Enough Examples\nMy issue is that this should be the norm and not the exception.\nIt is wildly unethical how hallucinations are not always on the front page of all of these products\nand services, considering the amount of damage they can cause. Oh but that would hurt sales we can't\ndo that. We should lie about it instead or intentionally draw attention away from it which is definitely\nnot just as bad!\nIt is very bleak seeing applications of AI that, at its current state, are wildly unsuitable, but\npresented ignoring all the potential issues they can cause.\nAccessibility, Effort &amp; Responsibility\nAnother one of the fundamental issues that I have with AI is how its become synonymous with a lack of\neffort and responsibility, often times marketed as accessibility. Allow me to explain.\nA lot of the applications of AI that you see online, completely flooding the internet, are things\nthat allow you to generate content. Create images and art without having to pick up a camera or\na brush, create articles without having to get good at writing, create videos without having to\nlearn editing or researching or sound mixing, you get the point.\nAll these are, for the most part, just not as serious or bad as the things I mentioned earlier.\nThey are however everywhere and ruining the internet.\nThere's a few problems with them. The most obvious one is the that they come from AI models;\nimages feel washed away, are blurry or just look impossible; hands with 20 fingers, things\nrandomly disappearing or getting warped etc. Articles feel hollow and often misleading or wrong.\nVideos sound bad, have no cohesive flow to them and just feel horrible and a waste of time to watch.\nAnd another problem: it all just ..feels the same.\nThe way these models work is they crunch up a lot of data from the internet and then sort of\nspit out the most likely results given their inputs. Apart from the obvious flaw being that there\nis in fact no \"brain\" or reasoning really happening and the fact that AI can't learn the same way\nhumans can, they also spit out \"averages\".\nI don't know about you but the average of anything online is often pretty bad. Statistically speaking,\nmost of anything can't be \"great\", that inherently implies that it is better than most other things\nin that space. Your mileage might vary depending on what you look at but the average programming\nresource for example is often not helpful, or can even be detrimental. Why? Programming is an\nimmensely complicated field. The same way not everyone that has driven a car can be a good racing\ndriver, not everyone that has programmed can be good enough to teach it.\nThis is not me being egotistical about it, that's just life, and that's okay. Everyone that knows me\nas a person knows I do not have much of an ego, in fact, I am too often too critical of myself and\nmore often feel underconfident rather than overconfident.\nEven looking at some of my older posts (some of which have even been removed from this\nwebsite), I immediately find a lot of things a don't like about them, whether that's about their\ncontent, their style or whatever else. Hell, I could say the same even about some of my more recent\nposts. I've written tenths of posts and I'd say I'm at the moment happy with maybe 3-4 of them.\nBut that's great! It means that I have grown both as a developer (since most my posts are about\nsoftware anyway) but also, at least to my eyes, at a writer.\nBeing bad is natural and necessary. I don't remember who said this but it has stuck with me for\na long time: \"You never stop being bad, you just get slightly less bad everytime you try\".\nThere's always improvements to be made and more room to grow.\nIt is natural to be bad at something but when you let AI be bad for you, you are robbed the\nexperience of becoming less bad.\nWhat's more is, as I said I am not a fan of most of my posts, I wouldn't call most of them useful.\nI wouldn't call them straight up wrong either though and I think those 3-4 posts I mentioned earlier\nwere actually both really insightful and useful. It's the type of stuff I would've loved to read\nbefore I lived through their lessons and experiences!\nWell, when you get AI to write for you, you don't get 10 or 20 meh posts and half a dozen good ones.\nYou get 500 posts, maybe a third of which contain errors and all of which offer nothing new\nbecause they are a rehash of the AI's training data. Admittedly, this is more so true for text,\nrather than other mediums which are harder to define originality for, but still.\nDo you see the problem with this? Search engines get so overwhelmed by billions of average posts,\nyou have a hard time finding anything useful. And it sucks.\nWe lived through the golden age of information over the last decades and are rapidly ruining so we\ncan post spam online.\nThis is such an incredibly short sighted movement I am honestly appalled.\nWhat happens when you use AI to create videos or music or artwork faster? You end up flooding\nthe search space, overshadowing actual humans that put effort into their work and achieve actually\ngood results. That's great for you for now I suppose, maybe you make some extra money. What happens\nwhen everyone else figures out that they can also make money for no effort you think. They do the\nsame. Now the market is flooded so badly, nothing is discoverable anymore, no one can earn anything,\nno one can consume anything valuable because there is none of that left and everything looks the same\nbecause it was all designed by AI to look and feel average.\nThe reason I spent so much time talking about this is because what people often say is \"but AI is\njust a tool! It just makes x more accessible!\" which I completely disagree with.\nThere is real value in making things more accessible and I think we should pursue that. In fact\nI'd argue that today, everything is the most accessible its ever been! You can\nfind heaps of information about anything you're interesting in. You have\naccess to nearly the entirety of all recorded human knowledge through your mobile phone. This is\nso easy to understate. Up until just a few years ago, we only had access to the books available at\nour local library and we had to wait weeks or even months to talk to someone just a few cities away.\nSports are cheaper to try out for, you can pick up music without even buying an instrument (which\nare also way cheaper than they used to be) and you can learn how to edit videos for free on YouTube,\non free editing software. This was all unimaginable a few years ago.\nI especially would know something about this, there perhaps is no other professional field as\naccessible as programming is right now. Entire university courses are free for you to read through\nonline, countless tutorials and guides and documentation and tooling that helps you immensely.\nThere are countless stories of self taught software engineers that did not attend any university\nand ended up landing big important jobs.\nBut at some point you have to sit down and put in some effort.\nProgramming illustrates this particularly well I think. Programming 40-50 years ago looked very\ndifferent than today's; we had programming languages that were a lot harder to work with and of course\nway fewer resources that taught you how to use them.\nWith time and expertise, we started trying to abstract away a lot of the hurdles of those languages\nand started creating newer languages &amp; tools with the goal of making them easier to work with, to make\nprogramming easier and more accessible. This of course continues to this day but the original\nproblems and hurdles we masked are still around. Maybe you don't deal with them as often but it is\noften a good idea to know about them as a programmer because sooner or later you'll find one of those\nhurdles ahead of you. But the modern languages of today don't make programming trivial. It reduces\nthe cognitive load on the amount of things we have to pay attention to and keep track of sure but\nwe still need to know a lot of things to write good software.\nThat is not how AI works, or at least it is not how I see it mostly pushed and advertised as. AI\nis often advertised as this tool that does the work for you, but that's not making anything more\naccessible, it is skipping the work all together.\nYou can't just claim or believe you can do something because you have an AI model doing it for you.\nWhat happens when something inevitably goes wrong? Are you prepared to take responsibility? Because\nthe AI isn't a person you can blame for its mistakes nor can you fire it in retaliation.\nVibe Coding\nOn the topic of coding, recently we've been seeing a wave of\n\"vibe coding\", the process of coding up entire projects\nby only using AI and some of the results of this movement have been hilarious to see in real time.\nWikipedia mentions: \"Vibe coding is claimed by its advocates to allow even amateur programmers to\nproduce software without the extensive training and skills required for software engineering.\"\nwhich is indeed an argument I've often heard people make in favor of vibe coding, and to that I\nraise you:\nOkay? Why do you want amateur programmers to produce software without extensive training and skills??\nJust in the last month or so I've seen multiple vibe coded projects riddled with security\nvulnerabilities being discovered, AI deleting someone's entire codebase by accident,\nsecret keys being made public for others to steal, sites being flooded with spam requests costing\na fortune in server bills, unmaintainable &amp; incomprehensible code, stupid performance bottlenecks\nthe list goes on and on.\nAll of these caused by ignorance, because these people just did not know any better and because AI\nallowed them to produce software without any training or effort or understanding of how it works or\nwhat it does.\nWould some of that had happened anyway? Of course. People make mistakes, vulnerabilities and bugs\nexist, but not this many, this quickly, at commercial, paid software with customers involved. A lot\nof these mistakes I mentioned above were extremely amateurish, some could even be criminal considering\nthese were in commercial products. Who bears the consequences and responsibility?\nLet me put it differently, in a way more people should be able to relate to. You can ask AI to\ndiagnose and consult it for your health problems. Say I come to you, and present myself as a doctor\nthat relies on AI for my diagnoses. I hope no one would be comfortable putting their lives on the\nimaginary hands of a glorified random number generator! Then why is it that people are so\ncomfortable putting their software and digital lives on the hands of AI? People often forget how\nmuch of our modern world depends on software and are all too comfortable and eager to submit\ntheir payment details on websites that are coded by AI apparently, let's hope that those don't\ncontain giant security holes that allows hackers to trivially steal critical personal information!\nWhy are we monetizing mediocrity with the added risk of being often wrong combined with\nlack of responsibility. Doesn't sound too appealing I'll be honest.\nI am not going to sit here and tell you that you should avoid AI like the plague and that you should\nnever ever dare to touch it. I've used AI to help me write code, but I already know enough programming\nto be able to reliably verify that what the AI programs is correct, which is why I've only used it\nfor easy, verifiable and unimportant tasks that I kind of know how to do already but may not\nremember the specifics off the top of my head. A common such example for me is using AI to help me\ncreate plots in Python for myself; they're easy in the sense that the code is short and readable\nand its not my first time making plots, I know what the code and the plot itself should look like\nso I can quickly tell if something is wrong. I use it more so like a tailored search engine\n(that is sometimes a bit wrong) than an assistant. An important detail is that I don't really care\nabout Python plots much as they are not something I need to do often (hence is why I forget the\nspecifics about them) which is great because everytime I've used AI to help me make one, I've\ncompletely erased its code from my memory mere hours later. I just don't see how people believe\nanyone can learn anything by letting AI do all the work for them, that's not how \"tools\" work.\nWhere does AI go from here?\nFrom the quite limited and largely superficial and surface-level knowledge I have on the field,\nI would imagine that AI won't go far as it is now and needs radical architectural changes for it to\nseriously improve.\nThankfully you don't have to take my word for it.\nProfessor Yann LeCun, widely considered one of the\nfathers of Deep Learning as a whole,\nrecently said:\n\"Auto-Regressive LLMs are doomed. They cannot be made factual [...]. They are not controllable. [...]\nIt's not fixable without a major redesign\".\n\nThis whole talk seems to be quite interesting. I haven't hard the time to watch it in its entirety\njust yet but it is in my backlog and I'd definitely suggest anyone reading this to take a look!\n\nWhat I am seeing in my own personal experiences is a lot of these models steadily plateauing and\nfalling deep into very diminishing returns. I think the only somewhat substantial improvements\nwe've seen recently (at least from the perspective of users) have been larger context windows\nwhich you should take with a grain of salt as many people seem to not be too satisfied with\nLlama 4's performance for instance, even though it has industry-leading context window of up to 10\nmillion tokens. And I guess some of the AI generated images look a bit better? Sometimes?\nWhen it comes to programming (and text generation in general), we still get a lot of hallucinations\nand honestly the quality really does not feel like it has improved much in the last few years though\nthat might just be me.\nI'm cautious about making such remarks about things I don't have a very in-depth knowledge of but I\nreally can't help but think that there is not a whole lot left in terms of quality improvements of\nLLMs. We might get entirely new architectures that completely bypass these problems and truly\nrevolutionize things like programming, but today we are just not there (or maybe even near anything\nlike that) just yet in my opinion.\nIt is rather hard to talk about generative AI and its future without mentioning the elephant in the\nroom: its legality and ethical concerns.\nI think we'll see more legal action taken against the companies behind these models regarding what\nthey included in their training data and how they obtained it and I'm honestly a bit surprised so\nmany businesses seem to not be concerned with that? If courts end up ruling that code generated\nby AI, trained on say Copyleft licensed code, are considered\nto produce code that should be licensed accordingly, then what? I know that's rather unlikely to\nhappen but its a bit question mark that I wouldn't take too lightly too soon.\nI understand that saying \"but muh ethics!\" when dealing with large corporations that don't shy away\nfrom the occasional human rights violation is rather naive but I can't just not mention the ethical\nquestions AI like this raises.\nLet us all remember that no explicit consent was given to these companies to train their models on\nopen source code and no attributions were given either. It can be argued that these companies\ninfringed on the copyrights of programmers by plagiarizing their code.\nOf course, code is one thing, training on text or art is also very dubious.\nWhere do We go from here?\nWhen it comes to the aforementioned impact of AI in the general internet, unfortunately there is not\na whole lot we can do (well except for advocating against spamming AI generated content on every\nplatform). One thing that has noticeably improved my experience of browsing online has been the use\nof browser extensions such as Control Panel for Twitter, uBlock origin with this block-list,\nUnhook for YouTube and probably some more + my browser's built in Ad block. Some of these of course\nare for advertisements in general and not specifically for AI but considering how many AI generated\nadvertisements I get, they help a bunch. Control Panel for Twitter helps a lot with limiting the\namount of bots I see on that platform so there's that.\nOf course all this is more like putting a band aid on the underlying issue or even looking the other\nway rather than tackling it directly but other than that I'm not sure what else can be done.\nRaising awareness definitely helps. I think a lot of the people using AI for generating content\nare either not fully aware of its shortcomings or haven't thought about how that affects searchability\nfor instance (or both). I would like to think that the majority of people doing this are not doing\nit because its a shortcut to making a bit more money because that is definitely not sustainable 😅\nWhen it comes to using it for things like programming, my opinion is very simple;\nProgramming is a skill, and unused skills, like muscles, atrophy.\nAI just does too much too often for you and I think you'll simply forget a lot of small things\nhere and there, ultimately growing yourself overly dependent on AI to program. Again, I've already\nnoticed this with myself and Python plotting which is why I don't want to use AI for anything more\ncommon (for me) or important than that.\nThe problem with over-reliance on huge tools like that is simple; you don't have any control over\nthem. Of course that's true with many platforms we programmers use, what about Github or cloud\nservices or Jira? Well, vendor lock-in is a real problem, but in the above examples you can\nin many cases side step it.\nGithub just stops existing? Well your code is just a git repository, you can \"just\" push it to another\nplatform.\nYour cloud platform of choice just stops existing? If you are a small-medium sized company that\ndeliberately tried relying more on open source tools that exist on more or less all cloud platforms\n(say Dockerizing your app or using PostgreSQL instead of vendor specific alternatives), then you\ncan maybe also switch though that sounds exponentially more painful, if at all feasible in practice.\n\nI think in this last paragraph specifically you can tell I have no professional experience because\nI have no clue how common or even possible it is to \"just use open source tools instead of\nthe overly convenient and potentially cheaper vendor specific offerings bro\" idea.\nI suspect that is just not practical for a lot of companies, just thinking about how convenient\nand cheap something like AWS Lambda is compared to permanently running a VPS almost invalidates\nmy entire point.\nHowever, I do think that if someone is determined to do that at all costs, they definitely\ncan. A good example of this is StackOverflow running entirely on prem.\nIs it for everyone? No. Is it possible? Yes. Is it retroactively possible? Realistically no unless\nyou've made most architectural decisions in support of this already.\n\n\"But there are many open source models we can self host, what's the difference?\"\nTruthfully, it depends on the cost (and quality of the open models though that seems to be very\nmuch okay from what I've seen which is incredible!) of running these models. Running one or a few\ninstances of a database for your entire business is one thing but I don't know how well these LLMs\nscale with the amount of employees; is it realistic to have 1 machine hosting an LLM with multiple\ndevelopers accessing it at the same time or would that be slow and you'd need more? I have not done\nmy research on this and can't answer that, I just know you need some very beefy machines to host the\nfull versions of these models and if you need one such machine every two-three employees that would\nget very expensive. Then again you might need 1 such machine for like 100 employees and this entire\nargument falls apart, I don't know do your own research ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nIt is just worth to keep in mind that a lot of the advantages of AI in programming is based around\nthem being fast and specifically faster than humans, if hosting them affordably means waiting for\noutputs for a while, it might not be that worth it in the end, just a money sink.\nAlso, all this assumes your company is on board with using AI in the first place. I admittedly do not\nknow about any companies banning use of AI for their software development but I can definitely see\ncompanies refusing to buy enterprise licenses in order to use such AI models because companies just\ndo that sometimes. Would suck to be over-reliant on AI and then end up in such a company.\nJira just stops existing? That's fine.\nAlso, this might sound a bit silly but like, programming is fun. I like software development. I\nwant to do software development, I don't want AI to do it for me so it can be done faster, that's no\nfun.\nClosing\nThis entire post has really made me feel like this:\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nIn hindsight much of this post must've sounded quite absolute which is not really how I am in face\nto face discussions with people but this is my own echo chamber so its harder to keep it well\nrounded. Also I just wanted to complain and not much sense goes in that usually.\nI think some of it was honestly borderline unreasonable. Like hm why do people not just\ndo more work. Because they're lazy, its human. I think the only way to \"fix\" this is by\nchanging what we consider \"good enough\". Then more work and effort will follow naturally.\nWhen it comes to the writing itself, how do people manage to write entire books??? This post was\n~9k words and I was already quite overwhelmed with remembering everything and re-reading it to\nmake sure it had at least some cohesion going for it. I think paying more attention into how I\nbreak the whole text down into more digestible units would help a lot, which is a good thing to\nrealize now because I will have to write a paper for my Bachelor thesis in ~2 months from now!\nIt was a bit funny having to worry about all these problems caused by writing \"too much\" text when\nmost my life I've been plagued by writing too little text 😅\nOn a bit of a side-note, I want to try and cite things where appropriate in my posts. I recently\nfound Dr. Tratt's blog (specifically this post was really insightful) and he does that a lot\nin his writing which I quite liked. I already make use of hyperlinks so I'll have to figure out\nwhen it makes sense to use which (or if it even makes sense to blend them?).\nBut let's start now (more-so because I want to make sure my CSS works properly). My first ever\nofficial citation shall be \"AI is ruining the internet\" by Drew Gooden[1], which I have probably\nre-watched 5 or so times already. It talks about a lot of the things that I already mentioned but\noffers a different perspective (namely more from an artistic background rather than a programmer's)\nwhich I think is interesting to look at (also the video is pretty funny).\nAll in all, I am more or less glad with how this post turned out, although I think this might just be\na one-of, I do like writing about software more than complaining anyway. Though I have to admit\nthat with all the stress from the last 1-2 months, it was neat to vent for a while.\nThis post was in fact so much longer and harder to keep track of than my previous one that I\nended up improving my workflow with some new checks, which I'll probably write about in my next\n(probably very short) post, after I ideally add them all to my CI as well.\nIn any case, till next time!\nFootnotes\n\n\nAI is ruining the internet (video) ↩\n\n\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/low-effort-everything/","title":"Low-effort everything"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/posharp/":{"body":"What is Veritas\nVeritas is a small testing framework that I am building for a friend's compiler. He started\nworking on this project recently and seeing as how I found it very interesting, I decided to contribute to it. I then remembered that\nI do not know how to build compilers so I instead decided to finally look into things like reflection and frameworks and decided\nto build one for his language.\nAll cool projects have 2 things in common: a pipeline badge and a mythological name, so I made a pipeline and found out that the Romans\nhad a goddess of truth called Veritas, somehow the Romans did not have a goddess of Unit\nTesting Frameworks so I unfortunately had to go with that.\nWhat does it do\nThe fact that building a framework that is written in one language and tests another one is complicated should not be a surprise.\nI essentially had to come up with a way of representing Po# code (that's what my friend called the language) as well as compiling,\nexecuting it and validating its output. I also wanted to make working with it not too different from commonly used frameworks as in\nI wanted everything to work through annotations, the tester should not have to worry about what was happening behind the scenes for the\ntests to work.\nBut what does using Veritas look like?\nI am glad you asked! Here's an example:\n\nIf the code seems weird to you then worry not for there are docs about it.\nI am not sure if this is a common thing under other languages or maybe under a different name but I have been doing a lot of C# lately\nand there is this concept of \"fluent\" syntax which essentially is code that is very intuitive and easy to read, almost like reading plain\nEnglish. I was heavily inspired by Fluent Assertions and I want to add/change some stuff on the\nVeritas interface to make it a little more like it as I really like using it, I believe you can already see that it heavily inspired\nVeritas' design.\nAt this point, you might have noticed the interesting return type, a boolean string tuple? The boolean indicates whether the test passed or\nfailed while the string holds a message useful for debugging (so if a test fails, it can show the difference between expected and actual\nvalue). I believe that because of how my test invocation works I cannot get the return value of the code directly, hence this ugly tuple,\nit's been some time since I \"designed\" this.\nAs I mentioned earlier, runtime exceptions aren't fully implemented into the language yet but when it comes to compiler exceptions you\ncan do the following.\n\nSomething similar will be added for runtime exceptions with possibly a .WithMessage option to verify that the code crashed with the\nappropriate message but that will depend on how concise those messages end up being. The compiler error messages are a bit too\ndev-debug friendly rather than language-user friendly for the time being so .WithMessage does not make sense for compile-time errors,\nthey essentially look like a small stack trace.\nAnother thing that is perhaps worth mentioning is the use of extension methods. Extension methods, in essence, add methods to a class from\noutside of this class. That sounds terribly boring until you realize how useful it is in some scenarios, in this case, it just looks a\nbit cleaner. Using extension methods I could ditch the old syntax of the tests that looked like this\n\nand instead go away with the class instantiation. I attached a few methods to the Scala String class which in turn call PoSharpScript\nunder the hood.\nScala implements extension methods through implicit classes;\n\nIPoSharp is a trait (or interface) that defines the 2 methods you can see below and PoSharpScript is the main class I use to interact\nwith Po# code. I made use of this recently as a wrapper to the PoSharpScript class since the logic was already implemented there,\nthis is purely for syntactic sugar.\nRunning the test code\nThis part is a little messy. Compiling and writing the assembly code to a file is easy since there are methods for this\nin the main package of the compiler but I also have to run it somehow. In case you haven't checked out the repo, you need WSL to run\nthe code, you cannot run some of the tools natively on windows. Thankfully, Scala has this Process\nclass that can help with that. I can use that class to spawn an external process that launches WSL and runs MAKE\n\nThis snippet returns anything that would normally get printed to the terminal if we were to run this command. TARGET_FILE is a variable\nused in the makefile to specify the .asm file as well as the executable.\nHow and why did I make use of multi-threading\nThe way the compiler works is: it gets fed some input in Po# from either a .txt file or in this case just a string, that gets parsed\nand compiled to NASM which gets dumped to a .asm file which we can now finally execute. That's cool but how can\nwe actually get the test output then? Well, there doesn't seem to be a good solution to this, or at least not one that I could come up with.\nWhat I settled for is reading the last thing that the code prints which of course requires the snippet to print something. As of now,\nruntime exceptions have not been fully added yet but when that happens, the same would apply for getting the exception message and I could\nadditionally check the exit code.\nExecuting the test snippets is terribly slow because of all the file accesses + compilation required + spawning the external WSL process.\nAt the time of writing this, 7 tests executed sequentially take 5-6 seconds, this will only get worse with more tests. Since there are only\nso many tests as of now we can afford to assign one test per thread (which seems to be the most efficient for the time being), that takes the\nexecution time down to around a second or two, this will hopefully scale much better than the sequential solution.\nSince a .asm file gets created for each test I need to make sure that they have unique names so the different threads don't cause issues.\nI decided to set the file name to packageName.className.methodName which should be unique at all times. These are also cleared after\nall tests are finished executing so no artifacts are left behind.\nI tried to think a bit ahead here and try to find out what would be a good future-proof optimization to make. Up until this point,\nspawning one thread per test is the most efficient way of running the tests which if you've done multi-threading may sound overkill\nand or counterintuitive but again, the process of running a test is very slow. But since it's probably not a good idea to allocate\nthreads in this way for 1000 tests I decided to allow for chunking the test methods per thread which should be the best of both worlds;\nit is not fully sequential so we have a performance boost but it also scales better since each thread will be handling more than one\ntest at a time. This should in theory be faster in the future when more tests get added compared to having a set amount of available\nthreads with one test each and having to wait for them to finish running before you allocate another one for the next test. Since it is\nstill early and I can't know what the optimal amount of threads or number of chunks is both are variables.\nDetecting test methods and invoking them\nI settled with the following:\n\nAll test classes must be in the test package\nAll test methods must be defined inside of a class annotated with @Test\nAll test methods must include the keyword test in their name\n\nI kind of combined what JUnit and PyTest do with the @Test and method names (although\nI think PyTest does it with filenames instead of method names). I could've made it so you need the methods annotated instead but decided to\ngo for this instead for no particular reason other than it will look a bit less cluttered. Since I consider tests to have test in their\nmethod name one can also easily define helper methods in the class and they won't be treated as tests.\nI found this a great library that allows you to easily use reflection.\nI first need to get all classes inside the test package which I achieve with the following:\n\nI then take the results of that query and extract the class names from the package. At this point, the class names\nshould look something like test.className.\n\nHere's where the more interesting things happen. We need to first get the class and then also create an instance for it\n\nThis may be a little confusing but the two are different; testClass is essentially a reference to the test class. This later\nallows us to use getMethods to find the tests inside of it which, in order to run, we need to instantiate it first hence the\ninstance. I made a separate method for executing the test since the code was getting a little cluttered. This just invokes the\nmethod and based on the return value, it prints whether the test passed or not.\n\nThis is a little bit simplified compared to the actual method; I wanted to be able to run this method from different threads\nso I had to use a synchronized StringBuilder for the outputs. In order to not lock it too often, I chunk the results to a\ntemporary StringBuiler and only push them to the synchronized one once the thread is done executing its tests.\n\nWas this necessary? No\nDoes it give any significant performance increase? Not really\nIs it cool that I did it regardless? Yeah 😎\n\nOn the topic of cool things, Scala has this library which makes it\neasy for you to use ANSI escape sequences and add some color to your prints!\nCreating the pipeline\nBuilding the pipeline was more complicated than it sounds. For starters, the project initially used SBT.\nWhen I was developing the framework I would test run it using Intellij which would compile everything with Java behind the scenes unlike\nSBT which uses Scala. Turns out the 2 have some runtime differences when it comes to the classloaders and the test classes could not\nbe detected so I eventually made a merge request that made everything work through Gradle which took a bit of fiddling around until\neverything started working again but at least the classloaders were not complaining anymore.\nAnother issue I had was getting the pipeline to work on an Ubuntu image which seemed to also have some classloader issues\nbecause the test methods could not get invoked. In case anyone is willing to take a look and potentially fix it, here's the\npipeline yml file.\nOther than that small hiccup, the rest was fairly standard stuff.\nI want the pipeline to run on master pushes and on pull requests. The job should run on a windows image, I checkout to the repo and use\nthis action to set up WSL, Gradle has a short post about setting up a Gradle build workflow\nhere which I used for the setup and finally I install any WSL\ndependencies I need and run the Gradle task for the tests\n\nAbout a month and a half had passed since I started working on Veritas before I finally saw this\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nand this\n\nThe future\nAs I mentioned earlier, the framework is not done which is to be expected since the language itself is not done evolving. Now that the\nthe pipeline is also complete I have reached a point where the framework is both capable enough to test anything currently present in the\nlanguage and can ensure that nothing breaks over time through the pipeline.\nThat being said, I now have the freedom to worry about more \"trivial\" things such as\n\nActual error handling that does not simply wrap the entire framework in a try-catch\nImproved error messages for anything that could go wrong\nSteal get inspiration from Fluent Assertions on new things to add\n\nOf course, this is what I can come up with now, more stuff will probably appear along the way as the language evolves.\nClosing\nAll in all, it has been really cool and interesting to work on this. It was really interesting to dive into reflection, it really\nis fascinating to me how you can interact with a project's source code through ... more source code. It also gives you a better\nunderstanding of how these frameworks function which is great. Multi-threading was another thing I enjoyed getting into, I recently\ndeveloped an interest to parallel programming and this is one of the ways I pursued that interest. It's nice knowing your code\nhelps someone and makes their lives easier but also more boring because who likes writing tests am I right?\nReally interested in seeing where this will go from now, till next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/posharp/","title":"Veritas"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/python_package_written_in_rust/":{"body":"Introduction\nI was always fascinated by the idea of different languages working together in a single codebase\nfor whatever reason. Rust seems to be especially good at this with\nits great C FFI (with projects such as\ncbindgen) and WASM\nsupport.\nConsidering how popular Python is, it should come as no surprise that there are tools available\nthat allow you to interface to and from Python, allowing you to leverage two very neat ecosystems.\nRecently, a friend of mine (again) started playing around with some map data which happened to be\nstored in the ASCII Grid format\nwhich is used often in\nGIS software. Turns out,\nthis format is pretty easy to parse (even for someone who is very bad at parsing stuff like me) so\nI wanted to see how hard it would be to make a Python package that used something like\nnom to parse the files. I won't be going over the specifics\nof my parser implementation as the blog post is focused on packaging Rust code and calling it from\nPython, not parsing. Plus, I'm pretty confident that all my code is terrible that you are probably\nbetter off without it :)\nThe Plan\nWhen I started looking into this, I wanted to at least answer the following questions:\n\nHow is the developer experience of writing the Rust package as well as calling it\nand how different is it from the way you write code in the respective language\nHow easy is developing such a project from the perspective of a developer\n(testability, running tests, REPLs etc)\nHow easy is it for someone who does not know Rust to use your package\nWhat could a deployment pipeline look like\n\nCreating the Library\nThe Rust Part\nWe first start by creating the library create which is just plain old Rust, nothing weird here.\nIn my case, all of my parser's logic is summed up in a parse method that is defined as follows:\n\n\nNotice the IResult type here? This is a\ntype definition from the Nom crate which\nas, I mentioned above, I use for parsing. There is nothing special about it in this context and\na normal Result or any other type would've worked just fine.\n\nThe AsciiGrid struct is also just plain Rust, for now, looks like this:\n\nSo how do we call this from Python? Enter PyO3 which provides\n\"Rust bindings for the Python interpreter\" and allows us to do just that!\nLet's add PyO3 to our Cargo.toml file\n\nNotice 3 things here\nThe name is actually the name of the Python module we will specify later. This does not\nnecessarily need to be the same as your crate name. This is what you'll use in your Python code\nimports when we eventually call our code from Python (import ascii_grid_parser).\nThe crate-type is for specifying that \"a dynamic system library will be\nproduced. This is used when compiling a dynamic library to be loaded from another language.\"\n[source].\n\nFun fact, if you ever try to import your code from another Rust module (say, a benchmark for\ninstance), it won't be discoverable because you need to also compile it as a Rust library. You\ncan get that to work by adding\n\ninstead!\n\nWe are also including the extension-module feature, this is for telling PyO3 that we are\nbuilding Python extension modules which are\nwhat allows us to interact with Python through C.\n[source]\nNow we need to tell PyO3 what we want to be able to use in Python, that includes both our parse\nfunction and the AsciiGrid struct. This is perhaps unsurprisingly easy to do with the power of\nRust's macros;\n\nThese are pretty self-explanatory. The\nPyResult type \"represents the result of a\nPython call.\" and is basically what we need to wrap any return value in to make it work with\nPython.\n\"What about error handling?\" I hear you ask. Well, you can use the\nPyValueError struct that\nrepresents Python's ValueError\nexception. To be quite honest with you, I don't really use Python so I am not too aware of what\npeople use for their errors and what common practices are there. I've seen ValueErrorss a few\ntimes and I just chose to use that in my scenario, if something else makes more sense for your\ngiven use case, you should probably go with that instead.\nFinally, we need to register both our function and struct to a Python module which is just as simple\n\nAnd that's all you need from Rust's side!\nIt is worth noting that if you add normal Rust comments to a pymodule, pyclass or pyfunction,\nthey will be visible from the resulting Python package!\nYou can also add a pyproject.toml file for some more configuration options, here's a sample of\nwhat that might look like\n(see here):\n\nSome Thoughts on the Code I Literally Just Showed You\nThe code I showed above is not exactly what I ended up with and for anything bigger than a\n100-line afternoon hack-it-together project, I'd recommend the following.\n\n\nDecouple the PyO3 stuff from your business logic. In the snippet above I changed the parse\nfunction (which is pure business logic) and polluted it with PyO3 types and macros. It would\ninstead be more convenient to separate the two in your code. What I actually ended up with\nis this:\n\nAs you can see, I kept parse the same as the original implementation I showed first and created\na separate parse_ascii_grid that calls it which will be the only one exposed to Python.\nMy reasoning for this is that it is simply easier to have pure, plain old Rust in as many places\nas you can to make your code easier to use and play around with in the Rust project itself.\nThe only part of your code where you should care about Python compatibility is the very top.\n\n\nSimilarly to this and perhaps even more importantly, you probably should do the same with your\nstructs. I say probably because I didn't care enough to make that change for my small project\nthat I worked on for the fun of it and no one, including me, will ever touch it again. If you\ndo care however then you should definitely think twice about this. You need to keep in mind\nthat applying all those macros in the same struct that you use internally might have performance\nimplications. I do not know exactly what these macros do or if this is even a problem that can\nhappen but in any case, you should research into it before adding it to your codebase. If you\nare reading this and know that this is/is not the case indeed then let me know in the comments :)\n\n\nAs always, please do read the docs.\nThe Python Part\nLet's go over how we can build the code we just worked on and call it from Python.\nThe PyO3 docs recommend that you use a\nvirtual environment (to be honest, you should always do this), see more\nhere.\nAfter creating a virtual environment and activating it, we install\nmaturin which is a tool (from the same org) that allows us to\neasily build (and later publish) our crate as a Python package.\n\nFor local development, you can run maturin develop which will build the package and add it to\nyour virtual environment. You can then open a Python shell (or run a file) and use the code!\n\nBuilding a wheel for your native platform is straightforward\n(as you probably noticed from the develop command above), you can run the following:\n\nYou will likely need to specify the interpreter as I did above which can just be the executable in\nyour virtual environment's folder. In my case, I am using Windows, hence the .exe.\nIf you want to compile for multiple architectures, however, things get more complicated and I once\nagain must recommend you read the docs.\nEven though Rust effortlessly compiles to any architecture you can think of, your Python interpreter\nis built specifically for the platform that you are using which is a problem. In theory, you\nshould be able to get this to work but I did not try as I could already see how many hours I would\nwaste on this. Instead, seeing as how I am quite familiar with GitHub Actions by now, I opted to\ndo all the building there instead.\nDeploying Through GitHub Actions\n\nNote: I later simplified the workflow and made it spawn way less jobs and its overall much less\nmessy thanks to some feedback I got on twitter. I'll leave the old version as well and I'll\nmention the cleanup in the next section.\n\nI like using on_workflow triggers for any sort of release I do using GitHub actions. Some people\nlike pushing tags or commits with special messages but I always found that a bit messy.\nThis is what we start with\n\nSince I was just experimenting, I decided to \"support\" a bunch of platforms such as\n\nmacos (x86_64)\nWindows (x64, x86)\nlinux (x86_64, x64, aarch64, armv7)\n\nIn my opinion, you should start with the absolute minimum of targets that you know you must\nsupport and add more later if needed. The workflow dispatch trigger allows you to run a workflow\non any branch or tag which means that if you ever need to run it on an older version of the code\nto add extra target compatibility, you can.\nThis is what my Windows job looks like\n\nI compile a wheel for both x64 and x86 for versions 3.7 to 3.11. I am using an existing\naction to do the building instead of managing that myself since it exists but you could just as\neasily replace that (although you'd have to manually set up maturin and what not).\nIn the end, I upload the generated wheels as\nartifacts\nwhich I use later.\nThe Linux job is mostly the same\n\nThe manylinux parameter is interesting as that allows your\nresulting binary to be valid in most Linux distributions, saving you from the whole lot of pain\nyou'd have to go through if you needed to create 1 job per distribution.\nYou might have noticed that I hardcoded architecture to x64 unlike before. It seems that Python\nonly understands x64 and x86 as you can see\nhere as\narchitecture values. I do admit that I am not sure if this then properly works in x86\nenvironments and I can't really test it myself. This is definitely something to watch out for if\nyou are doing this yourself. The workflow passes with no errors or warnings but then again, this\nis Python we are talking about, not Rust, this does not guarantee that anything will work properly.\nFixing this would be easy as you could add a check to see if your current ${{ matrix.target }} is\nx64 and if not, set the arch to x86.\nMacs were... interesting.\nTurns out GitHub\nis a bit limiting\nwhen it comes to Mac runners as you can only run 5 at a time. For some reason, I could only run 4\nbut that is besides the point. Every matrix entry spawns a separate runner which is an issue\nhere. I instead removed the matrix and put everything on one runner.\n\nThis is ugly but oh well. There is also a limit for 20 runners total (40 for pro) so you might want\nto keep this idea around if you are compiling to a lot of targets.\nNow to actually upload the artifacts:\n\nNot sure if the user is required but there it is. Even though this looks very messy, it only\ntakes about 5 minutes for everything to finish running in my case. Of course, this very much\ndepends on how complicated your crate is. You need to define a PYPI repository secret and set\nits value to an API token from PyPi for this to work of course.\nAgain, I feel like there are a lot of improvements you could make in this but it all greatly depends\non your specific use case. You might want to for instance not spawn as many runners, you might want\nto spawn a set amount of Mac runners to distribute the work (say one builds 3.7-3.9 while another\nbuilds the rest) etc etc. That said, I do think that this is a more than decent starting point\nthough.\n\nThe version of the Python package will be automatically set to the version you mention in your\nCargo.toml, atlhough weird version names (i.e. not just X.Y.Z) might change a bit.\nIn my case, my Cargo.toml version was set to 0.0.1-alpha.4 but PyPi's was 0.0.1a4.\n\nCleaning Up the Workflow\nThanks to @messense for his reply :)\n\n\n\n\n  \n    \n   \n\n\n\nTurns out we can indeed specify multiple interpreters instead of spawning one task per version.\nThis, in my case, makes the workflow a bit slower which is to be expected since less work is\nparallelized. It still only took about 2 minutes extra however and for most people, spawning\nthat many jobs is much bigger of a bottleneck than waiting an additional few minutes.\nWe can make the following changes (both windows and Linux are essentially the same again):\n\nand for Mac we can remove the matrix all together and shorten it significantly:\n\nWhat Did We Learn?\nLet's revisit the questions we asked at the beginning of all of this.\n\n\nHow is the developer experience of writing the Rust package as well as calling it and how *different* is it from the way you write code in the respective language\nThis was spot on. From Python's point of view, this is just another ordinary package while from\nRust's perspective, not much change or new stuff is required, especially if you limit the scope\nof the PyO3 stuff as I mentioned earlier.\n\n\nHow easy is developing such a project from the perspective of a developer  (testability, running tests, REPLs etc)\nOnce again, spot on since it is very closely related to the first point. The Rust devs will need\nto have a Python interpreter available whilst the Python devs can just import the wheels which is\ngreat!\n\n\nHow easy is it for someone who does not know Rust to use your package\nAgain, very much related to the 2 points above, no one will even know your package is written in\nRust (unless of course the words \"written in Rust\" have somehow not made it to your repository's\nREADME and description ;) )\n\n\nWhat could a deployment pipeline look like\nWhile I definitely don't really like how repetitive it turned out, the problem is ultimately\nPython itself and not the tools we used in this project. It is good enough and definitely not too\nslow, that's what you want for the most part.\n\n\nOverall, slightly surprised by how easy this was 😅.\nConclusion\nI would say that this is definitely a realistic path to consider if you either want to optimize a\nspecific part of your codebase or to, as I did here, leverage Rust's ecosystem in your Python\nproject.\nThere's a good chance that you will get a \"free\" performance boost by writing parts of your code\nin Rust, assuming of course your code is sound. In my case, I parsed through my data\n5.3 times faster (42s vs 8.8s) with the Rust implementation compared to a reference Python parser I\nstole from a blog post.\nIn fact, I managed to get it down to only 4.1s (11.7 times faster!) by applying the following to my\nCargo.toml:\n\nOf course, both definitely have massive room for optimization so this isn't necessarily a fair\ncomparison. In my case, I parsed over 2858 files that total at around 160mb so there is a lot of\nIO happening which you usually should avoid but what do I know, I didn't benchmark anything :)\n(please benchmark your code before and after you \"optimize\" it)\nOf course, if you are doing this for fun like me, go ahead!\nTill next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/python_package_written_in_rust/","title":"Python with a bit of Rust"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/rewrite_cs_in_rust/":{"body":"Introduction\nA few years ago I worked on a notification service that would get upcoming appointments scheduled in\nMicrosoft Bookings\nand send a text message reminder to the person who made the appointment a few days prior.\nThis was in an effort to reduce the amount of appointments that were cancelled too late for a new\none to be booked in their place as well as make it less likely for people to forget about their\nappointment altogether. This was not too hard to make and it worked wonders! I recently ended up\nrewriting it in Rust over two afternoons and I ended up reflecting on a few things that I found\nmyself wanting to write about so here we are!\n\nAs a small note, I don't think I'll have too many useful things in here, mostly just my hindsight\nthoughts about stuff. I just haven't written anything in a while and wanted to get back into\nit again.\n\nWhat did the project look like?\nThe project was using AWS Lambda for hosting,\nSNS for sending text messages and\nSM's parameter store\nfor storing an encrypted refresh token.\nThe appointment data was grabbed from\nMicrosoft's Graph API which also meant\nconfiguring some stuff on\nAzure Active Directory.\nWhat did I dislike about the old implementation?\nAs I mentioned though, I worked on this about two years ago and while that may not sound like much,\nit feels like quite a long time ago if you were relatively new to programming at the time. I've since\nchanged the way I write code quite a bit and if you do not actively dislike code you wrote that long\nago you have got to be doing something wrong!\nFor starters, it was written in C# which I have not really used at all since and even though it is\na \"simple\" language, I would much rather have it written in something I actively use today.\nAs you may have noticed, there are a lot of working parts and services involved in this project\n(or at least for me, I don't know if this is more common to anyone reading this!), this means\nhandling a lot of potential errors even if my code does not actually do all that much. This was an\nabsolute breeze in Rust with its Results and Options while in C# I got caught off guard more than\nonce with something blowing up in production because it was not always obvious when something\nmight or might not explode.\nA lot of the tooling I used was simply a lot less convenient than what I am used to in Rust,\ntalking specifically about dates and JSON (de)serialization. Now, I am not saying that both of these\nare necessarily substantially better in Rust, but they are better than the ones I used. I simply\ndo not use C# enough to know the best tools for these things, there may have been (or since developed)\nway better libraries, I just don't know about them. Rust's\nserde_json is great and\nchrono is simply fantastic. I cannot stress how great it is to\nexpress timezones in the type system, saved me so many headaches.\nTo run my code locally I had to use\nsome official command line app\nthat was just annoying to use. I understand it is in preview but it has been in preview since at\nleast 2 years ago and it looks the same as it did back then. When I switched to Rust I used\ncargo lamnda which was a lot better.\nA small tangent (me ranting)\n\n\"But C# has added those cool nullable T? types that effectively function as Rust's options,\nwhat is so different with them that you can't handle them!\"\n\nExcellent question! Well, since this C# feature, now also present in most other similar languages\nI can think of actually, is more of an afterthought;\n\nit did not exist in the language originally, this means that a lot of code was written before\nthis was even added so it could not have been used.\nsince backwards compatibility is a thing, nothing is stopping anyone from declaring a type as\n\"non-nullable\" (ie, T instead of T?) and then simply setting it to null at some point.\nThis is a fundamental problem with these languages that I can't see how it could be remedied.\nSo while seeing T? in signatures is convenient, you might as well treat all Ts as nullable\nas well which kind of defeats the purpose.\n\nAnd of course exceptions, unlike Results, are not always obvious that they can be thrown.\nSometimes they are mentioned in the docs, sometimes they are not, especially when they are deeply\nnested ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯\nThe main problem\nMy main issue was really just how I wrote the code, regardless of whatever tooling I used. At the\ntime, a bunch of \"clean code\" and enterprise-style Java was fresh in my mind from university\ncourses and projects so you can bet I was dependency injecting absolutely everything. I was not\nquite at the level of abstract factory builder factories but I had my fair share of unnecessary\nabstractions.\nThis was in retrospect a great decision because I really got to see how terrible that type of code\ncan often be, especially when you need to work on it for a few years. The mental complexity of\neverything was so high I had to spend a few minutes each time I wanted to make a small change just\nto remember where each service and interface was located. Debugging was even worse because of this.\nI don't exactly regret it per se because I remember that at the time I wanted to learn more about\nthat style of programming and I intentionally included a bunch of those ideas in my codebase. Had I\nnot done this, who knows, I could still be advocating for \"clean code\", instead I lived to tell the\ntale.\nSo how did the rewrite go?\nIt was pretty smooth actually but as I said, the code that I had to write in the end was not that\nmuch. Plus, the second time you do anything is significantly easier than the first so no surprises\nthere. I ended up with about ~500 lines of code in the end but that included some new functionality\nthat took about 100 lines, as I said it was really not that much. Still about half of my original\ncode though so that's always a nice thing to see.\nI am quite happy with the DX improvements, especially the local environment and deployment speeds.\nEnding up with a 6mb zipped binary is definitely helping that over the 400mb Docker image I had\npreviously!\nClosing thoughts\nWould I do it again? Probably.\nAlthough I don't think I will ever really like these very \"managed\" environments like AWS Lambda.\nThey work fine and all but I really just like having a normal project I can just run from my\nterminal with no instrumentation required. Lambda is often too convenient unfortunately so there's\nthat I guess.\nBut anyway, that was fun nonetheless.\nTill next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/rewrite_cs_in_rust/","title":"Rewriting it in Rust"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/rss2email/":{"body":"Introduction\nI picked up Rust about a month ago and have been loving it.

I intend on referencing this post during my Postman talk and thus I want\nto spell out many of the dependencies I used as they might not be obvious to beginners.\n\nA GET request is sent to each feed using ureq\nThe feeds are parsed into structs using serde (serialization crate)\nThe core logic is mostly pure Rust but I do use regex,\nchrono (DateTime), and itertools\n(Extra iterator methods)\nThe email part is just one HTTP request to a remote API\n\nDownloading the Web Feeds\nGetting our Links\nLet's start with a slightly simplified version of the method I wrote;\n\nInterestingly enough, this is might have changed slightly by the time you are reading\nthis article as detailed in this issue.\nIn any case;\n\nI expect the user to have a feeds.txt file with all his links. That file:\n\nShould have one link per line\nCan have comments that start with # (more on this in a bit)\n\n\nI make sure to split the file contents by newline into a vector\nTrim and filter out empty lines just in case\nRemove duplicate links\nCollect to a vector of Strings\n\nNot sure what you're used to calling them, iterator methods, stream API, lambdas, LINQ but\nI absolutely love these in all languages. They are always a very powerful yet clean and concise\nway of describing some operations on data that they are an indispensable part of most of the code\nI write.\nThe great thing about rust is that these are claimed to be \"zero cost abstractions\", this means that\nthey come with seemingly no performance overhead. I have mostly used these iter methods in Java, Scala,\nand C# and for those languages, I know that they have performance issues, especially when compared to say\nfor loops. I believe that C# has some overhead from instantiating some iterator class behind the scenes\nwhile the JVM has cold start issues, whatever the case might be, all you need to know is that Rust\nsimply does not suffer from this; you can and should use these iter APIs.\nComing back to the actual code, I mentioned earlier that I wanted to support comments in the\nfeeds file. For reference mine looks like this:\n\nI have way too many links and this commenting system helps me keep track of what's what.\nThe actual method looks like this;\n\n#.*$ matches a # followed by any number of characters and stops at the end of the line.\nIf you read the docs from the link I left in that comment you'll find the following;\n\nIt is an anti-pattern to compile the same regular expression in a loop since\ncompilation is typically expensive.\n[...]\nwe recommend using the lazy_static crate to ensure that regular expressions are\ncompiled exactly once.\n\nDo I need this? Definitely not but I mean why should I not use it? Defining this\nexpression as a simple static (const in Rust) would not work in this case because\nthe Regex constructor is not a const so we need to use static.\nThe rest of the code remains the same except for that RE.replace_all(&amp;l, \"\") which\nremoves the comments from the text before processing it further.\nDownloading\nI define the following helper methods to handle the downloads:\n\nThere's a bit of code here but it's relatively simple; download the page if the content\ntype is set to one of the supported ones, otherwise, return\na Download Error.\nNow that we have a way of reading the user-defined links and downloading them, it's time\nto process them!\n\nTLDR:\n\nWe iterate over our links\nDownload their contents and parse them to Blogs (more on this later)\nFilter by posted in the last n days\nCollect\n\nThat's all of the \"business logic\" of the project, this one method. The result of this\ngets directly mapped to HTML and emailed but before we check that part out, let's see\nwhat all those Blogs and Posts are...\nRepresenting Web Feeds\nWhen I started this project, I thought to myself \"oh well this should be simple, I just\ndownload the RSS feed and parse it!\". Well, that's not far from the truth but what I did\nnot know was RSS is just one Web Feed format, there's another one called Atom that is\nalso very popular.\nHere are some links in case you are interested;\n\nWeb Feeds\nRSS Spec\nAtom Spec\n\nSo we already have a small problem, that being that we have 2 different possible inputs\nthat represent the same thing. In addition, some fields that I need are not mandatory\n(such as dates for instance) which I need to handle.\nThis lead me to create the following structs that represent any web feed;\n\n\nSmall edit here, I've made a few changes to the codebase already while\nwriting this article because I kept realizing some stuff could be better.\nIn this case I switched from DateTime&lt;FixedOffset&gt; to DateTime&lt;Utc&gt;\nfor consistency. This post would take forever if I kept detailing every\nsmall change like this so I will just focus on more important, high-level\nmodifications. If you want to copy paste some stuff from my code, I'd recommend\ncopying from the repository instead of here.\n\nNow this part of the code I am not particularly proud of and I think that\nif I remade it now I'd design it completely differently but again, keep in mind I am\nstill very new to the language and this was one of the first things I did.\nI kept getting progressively annoyed by how I implemented this abstraction and I am quite\nhappy with how I did it later on for the emails, if you want a \"good\" example of abstractions\nin Rust, that one probably comes closer to it, definitely not this one but here goes;\n\nThe idea is to, again, abstract away from a specific, underlying implementation\nand treat everything the same. This might make more sense later when you see how\nthese are used.\nRSS and Atom Concrete Implementations\nRemember that the feeds look like this:\n\nThe corresponding structs are as follows;\n\nSkipped the macros for the sake of readability.\nWe now need to implement the traits I defined earlier. I won't be showing these in detail\nas they are fairly boring, I'll instead just list them out;\n\nNow that all that bloat is out of the way we can finally write the one method we\ntruly are about:\n\nIt is worth noting that you should probably not use Strings for your errors but\neveryone has to start somewhere right?\nThe idea behind this was to try and parse the given XML in all formats until one succeeds.\nWe then use this super handy partition_result method which splits the successful results\nfrom the errors. Lastly, if any of these succeeded then we return the result, otherwise,\nwe throw an error.\nSending Emails\nFinally covered all of that web feed representation stuff, definitely feels like quite the\nmess but I am not exactly motivated enough to go back and make it better.\nIf you know any Rust (or even if you don't honestly), I feel like you would agree with me\nthat this is a relatively messy solution right? I mean it does work, don't get me wrong,\nbut I would not want to \"teach\" this to someone.\nThe reason why I included it is to contrast it with this section that deals with the emails\nbecause the two could not be further apart in my opinion and I am hardly ever satisfied\nwith my code so this should mean something.\nThe idea with the emails is that everyone might have their own favorite provider and I shouldn't\nlimit them. I used Twilio SendGrid which is the only available\nimplementation currently. It is, however, extremely easy to add more implementations\n(which I wouldn't say for the web feeds) as you'll see soon.\nThe core of the email-related code is the EmailProvider; an abstraction\nover an email backend\n\nLet's see the SendGrid implementation before explaining why this works much better than before:\n\n\nThe message was omitted for the sake of readability and can be found here.\n\nWe define a simple struct with a constructor and implement the send_email method for\nEmailProvider. The implementation isn't too exciting; it's just a formatted string\nsent to the SendGrid API.\nThis is where it gets a little more interesting.\n\nThis enum in combination with a String -&gt; EmailProvider converter;\n\nallows me to finally declare this method\n\nThis first obtains the EMAIL environment variable (or overwrites it to SENDGRID if not found)\nand uses the From trait we implemented earlier to convert that to an Email Provider.\nThis is great because:\n\nThe consumer of get_email_provider does not need to know what is happening\nAdding a new email provider means only adding one new entry in the EmailProviders enum and\nour from function.\nThis is all type-safe, and guaranteed to work; the EmailProvider is bound to assume\nsome value before we try to interact with it.\nAll implementations are concentrated in one spot and it's easy to edit them.\n\nAWS Lambda\nI recently deployed on AWS Lambda for the first time. It was a C# function that would run once a day\nand send text messages to help my dad keep track of some of his appointments which as you may have noticed\nis relatively similar to what I am building here.\nI wanted an easy way to deploy this and run it with a CRON job and AWS makes both very easy.\nThere are two parts to this:\n\nAdding the AWS Rust Runtime\nDockerizing the app\n\nAdding the Runtime\nAWS Lambda uses Runtimes to support any language\nout there (as long as they have an implementation of it of course). This means that making our code run on Lambda\nis not as trivial as just pushing it there. Luckily for us, we don't have to\nbuild our own custom runtime\nas the AWS folks have handled that already in this crate.\nIf you want a guide on how to use it then just go ahead and read their docs as they are quite straightforward.\nI will instead talk about Conditional Compilation\n.The runtime needs a lot of dependencies, around as many as the rest of the project if I recall correctly.\nIn addition to that, as I likely mention somewhere, I want this project to be as easy to run as possible and\nthe Lambda runtimes always complicate things somewhat in addition to bloating the project and doubling\nmy compilation times. Ideally, I would want to have a way to separate the core project from the Lambda stuff\nand in fact, early on I achieved this with Git by having 2 separate branches but that was certainly annoying.\nIf only there was a simple way to solve this problem.\nIntroducing conditional compilation! Only compile the parts of the code that you choose! This is done through\nfeatures.\nThere are 2 parts to this;\n\nThe dependencies\nThe code\n\nThe Dependencies\nTo tell Cargo that some of your dependencies are to only be included when certain features are specified\nyou need to declare the dependency as optional like so:\n\nAnd to actually include it with a feature you can do this:\n\nI do this with another 3 dependencies but you get the idea.\nThe Code\nOf course, this only makes sense if you can define whether some pieces of the code are specific to a feature\nor not. I think that there's more than one way to do this but what I did is something like the following:\n\nI made 2 different main methods! The second method calls code defined in a module that is also annotated\nwith #[cfg(feature = \"aws-lambda\")] while the first one just calls \"normal\" Rust code.\nI found this very useful for this specific use case but I can also see how convenient this is if you are dealing\nwith platform-specific code. Another nice application of this would be to let users decide which modules\nof your library they actually need instead of importing a giant framework to use 1 method.\nChoosing these features is done by appending --features aws-lambda to your cargo commands, for instance,\ncargo run --features aws-lambda. This as you are about to see is also made use of in the Dockerfile.\nThe Dockerfile\nCredits for the Dockerfile go to this post but I'll\ninclude a short explanation here anyway.\nThis is the full Dockerfile:\n\nLet's break it down.\n\nI use alpine as they usually are somewhat lighter than the standard images.\nI also name this stage\nbuilder.\nThe compile_flag is used to optionally include --features aws-lambda as a\ncommand line argument.\nmusl-dev was needed for one of my cargo dependencies so I need to install it\nI create a new and empty cargo project and paste in my Cargo.lock and\nCargo.toml files, I do this in order to compile all my dependencies separately\nfrom the rest of the project to make better use of the caching mechanism. After\nthis, we remove all source files (the main.rs that cargo new generates) and\nall created executables since neither are related to my project.\nI add in my source directory and build it. By doing this here we make sure that\nany change in the source code that is not accompanied by the addition or removal\nof dependencies will use the cache up to this step, saving us a lot of time.\nAfter all this, I finally copy the executable over to a new stage, and lastly, I add\nthe .env and feeds.txt. By adding these 2 files last, similarly to earlier,\nwe will make use of the cache up to this step which means we will be completely\nskipping any compilations and thus the build will only take one or two seconds.\n\nThis isn't really relevant to the rest of the project but as someone who likes\nusing Docker, Rust offers a very neat, simple and efficient solution for a\ncompiled language. My last experience with Docker was trying to dockerize a\nScala project which is, in stark contrast, messy, convoluted and somehow still\nterribly slow.\nBenchmarking\nProper benchmarking is something I started getting interested in relatively recently.\nMore specifically (and at this point unsurprisingly), the small testing framework I have been\ncontributing to PoSharp was quite slow at its first\nimplementation(please make dumb but working implementations before you start optimizing).\nAfter a few headaches and some good old 4 am coding, I managed to make it\n2 or 3 times faster which was great. I also optimized the workflow duration from around 10 minutes\nto 2-3 if I remember correctly which was pretty cool if you ask me. All of this was the combination\nof a few educated guesses about performance and a lot of benchmarking. It reinforced why\nbenchmarking is important to me.\nComing back to Rss2Email, running this thing was a bit slower than I expected at first;\nI had around 30-40 links at the time, and running the code locally would take around\n13 seconds give or take. In this case, it is relatively obvious to say that this is\na Network bound program but I wanted to have a very clear point of reference for future\ncomparisons so I wanted to benchmark this regardless.\nI wanted information on how long specific methods took to run so I started looking into\nCriterion which is a great library. As I'll explain\nshortly, these were unsurprisingly conclusive that indeed, the issue is the Network IO\nwhich is why I will probably be adding asynchronicity to the project at some point.\nBecause of that, I will likely write some application-level benchmarks with\nHyperfine to have some nice before and after\ncomparisons but that's work for another day.\nI opened a Hacktober issue for\nthe Criterion benchmarks and it was the first one to receive a contribution. I added\nsome stuff to it myself and found this interesting enough to write about it.\nAlso, a short note, I just realized at the time of writing this that the plots are a bit\nsmall. You can still read them but it's mildly annoying, sorry for that. They are, however,\nSVGs so you can easily right-click &gt; open in new tab and zoom in as much as you want :)\nI don't think that the code behind these is particularly interesting but if you want,\nyou can check it out yourself\nhere.\nMapping to HTML\nThe first thing I wanted to benchmark as a test and to get Criterion all set up was the\nmethod that maps the Blogs to HTML.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nNot exciting as turns out, code is fast.\nDownloading Blogs\nCriterion generated the following plot.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nWe can see that this is a bit faster than the 13 seconds that I mentioned earlier which\nis most likely because I was running in debug mode while Criterion uses Release by default.\nFrom this, we can very easily see where the performance drops, and spoiler alert, it is, in\nfact not in mapping the blogs to HTML but actually downloading them, who would've thought?\nI had one question after this, and that was whether some blogs were disproportionally slower\nthan the rest. Since this is a purely blocking and synchronous process, that would slow\ndown the code quite a bit. That's what the next test is about.\nDownloading Blogs One by One\nUnfortunately, as you can tell, whatever plotting library Criterion uses does not\nexactly like how long these links are but it's not particularly important to actually\nbe able to read them. These links are the feeds I am currently following so feel free\nto manually search them and see if you find them interesting I guess.\n\n  \n  \n    \n    \n  \n  \n  \n  \n\nUnexpectedly, I was actually right, one of these takes way longer than average and as I\nexplained previously, this does bring down performance quite a bit.\nThis is the type of insight I was hoping to gain from an analysis like this so I am\nmore than happy.\nConclusions\nAs I mentioned earlier, I wanted to pinpoint the areas that make my performance drop so that\nI can have very clear goals and points of reference when I try optimizing them.\nMy key takeaways from this are:\n\nThis project is heavily Network IO bound\nRight now, individual feeds can affect performance a lot if they are disproportionally slow\n\nBoth of these indicate that adding asynchronicity would be a great performance improvement\nand hence, will be something I'll do soon.\nThe Future\nThe project is definitely working as is and I don't have any specific ideas for brand-new\nfeatures in mind. That said, some small modifications are planned, namely;\n\nImproving the docs and getting started pages\nSome more testing\nAdding async support\nPrettier emails\nUsing environment variables for easier configuration\n\nI linked to the issues associated with some of these, the other 2 will probably be tackled by\nme after the other 3 have been closed.\nYou are more than welcome to\nopen issues if you have any ideas!\nClosing\nThis was a fantastic learning experience for me and the end result is something that I have\nbeen using ever since it was usable.\nIt was interesting dealing with community contributions as I made a few Hacktober issues that\ngot picked up by random people I did not know. It was also interesting incorporating\nsome ideas from solutions I came up with for other repositories (through Hacktoberfest)\ninto this .project\nAnd lastly, being offered the chance to talk about this in front of an audience is one I am\nvery much grateful for! I love helping people figure programming out\nand I hope I find myself in more similar situations in the future :)\nTill next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/rss2email/","title":"Rss2Email"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/simple_jwt/":{"body":"Simple JWT Authorization with .NET\nRecently I have been working on a side project that needed a very simple toy-like auth\nscheme to be implemented. The last few times I implemented JWTs in .NET it was for a full-blown\napplication which means that I made use of things like IdentityModel and UserManager.\nIn this case, I did not need Authentication, just Authorization. The two are defined as followed\nin the MS Docs.\n\nAuthentication is the process of proving that you are who you say you are. [...]\nAuthorization is the act of granting an authenticated party permission to do something.\nIt specifies what data you're allowed to access and what you can do with that data.\n\nFor my use case, simulating a credential check is enough; I don't need to store and check\npassword salted hashes to make sure a user is indeed who he is supposed to be as this is a toy app\nthat I am working on with supposedly just one user. All this means that if you are looking for a\ntutorial on how to implement Auth for your new project, this is probably not the article for you,\nit is just a less verbose way of dealing with JWT generation and validation that works for me.\nThat being said, let's get started.\nSetup\nThe only package I used is JWT.Extensions.\nI created 3 classes that make everything work:\n\nJwtConfig: Holds the JWT secret which is provided in the application.json file. Could also be\nused for other pieces of configuration such as the token lifespan\nSecured: An attribute that when attached to a controller or a specific endpoint requires a\nvalid token to be provided in the request header\nTokenService: A very simple interface to the JWT.Extensions API that helps us create and\nvalidate tokens.\n\nThe JwtConfig\nLet's start with the config class first. The idea with this is pretty simple; have a section in our\nappsettings.json file where we define crucial security information in plain text, what could\npossibly go wrong! On a more serious note, while this is fine for developing, you should definitely\nuse something like app secrets\nor plain old environment variables for this. Once again, my app is not supposed to be secure so I don't\ncare.\nThe class itself is pretty simple in my case:\n\nAnd here's my settings file\n\nNow that that's out of the way, let's make sure we use the secret from our settings file in the\nJwtConfig instances.\nI made it so the class is registered as a singleton in the DI container, the binding itself is\npretty simple:\n\nI used nameof just because I wanted to be sure that the config file's section is titled the\nexact same as the class itself to avoid confusion, this is just a string so swapping it out for\n\"JwtConfig\" would change nothing.\nSince we are here, let's also configure some basic settings for our tokens\n\nThis is taken straight from their documentation\nso I won't be explaining it too much, just know that we are telling the package to use\nthe key we just defined and we are also using the HMACSHA algorithm.\nIt is worth noting that this throws us a warning as this is no longer considered secure\nand it is recommended to \"consider switching to RSASSA or ECDSA\". Once again, for the purposes\nof my use case, this is not a concern.\nThe TokenService\nThis is where most of the interesting stuff happens. Let's first create the class, get our\njwtConfig secret and assign it to a JwtBuilder instance which we'll use later.\n\nCreating the token itself is also pretty much copy-pasted from their\ndocs.\n\nI only use the expiration date and username for claims.\nLastly, verification.\n\nI only need a true or false return as I don't care why the token was not valid. In case the token is a\nvalid JWT but it is expired, json will be null. If on the other hand, the signature is invalid,\nthen an exception will be thrown for whatever reason.\nThe Secured Attribute\nAs I mentioned earlier, all this is glued together by the use of attributes. For this to work,\nwe need to implement the IAuthorizationFilter interface. This will make it so our code will be\nexecuted to determine whether a request should be authorized or not.\nThe code for this is also simple but let's go over it step by step\n\nAs I mentioned earlier, I want this to apply to both endpoints and entire controllers, hence\nthe first line. In order to implement IAuthorizationFilter, we need to define the OnAuthorization\nmethod. We use the IServiceProdiver to retrieve our JwtConfig instance and make sure it is not null.\nWe then instantiate TokenService and retrieve the token from the request header. Finally, we make sure\nto throw an Unauthorized message to the user if the token is invalid, otherwise, the request pipeline\nwill proceed as expected.\nAnd that's it! We can now add our newly created attribute to whichever controller or endpoint we want\nand it will be locked behind a valid JWT requirement.\nClosing\nThis pretty much concludes the article! As I mentioned earlier, this is a very specific and lacking\nimplementation, the main point of the article was to showcase how you could use your own attributes\nto simplify the process which to me feels simpler (and less verbose) compared to some of my previous\nimplementations.\nThis is probably the most boring article I've written so far but I promise you that the project I am\ngoing to use this for is interesting. It's also a lot harder than anything I've tried before so don't\nexpect that the be out anytime soon.\nTill next time :)\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/simple_jwt/","title":"Simple JWT"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/simple_rust_macros/":{"body":"Introduction\nRust's macros are quite powerful, whether you use them to avoid boilerplate code, make a crate's\ninterface easier to work with or even define entire domain-specific, type-checked languages.\nOne of the main issues with macros is how hard it is to get started making them. If you've ever\nseen a macro definition in the wild, you know how weird and cryptic they can get, especially\nprocedural macros.\nAs a result, many (likely most) beginners simply stay away from them (or well, at least I did).\nIt is however worth remembering that non-procedural macros are not that bad and considering how\nuseful they can be when used correctly, so much so that I would argue that it's a good idea for\neveryone to know a little bit about them.\n\nA little heads-up, I generally like turning my posts into little stories instead of just focusing\non the main topic in isolation as I think it is useful (and interesting) to talk about how we got\nthere, why we needed and what alternatives were tried beforehand. In this case, that background\ncontext was quite a bit so if you are not interested in that, feel free to skip to\nhere :)\n\nSetting the Stage\nRecently, I worked on a simple Mandelbrot renderer\n(that README has a pretty cool video included 👌, I think you should check that out if you're\nreading this). I found fractals really intriguing for a while so I was bound to make something\nlike this at some point. The main reason why I ended up building it now was an interest in\nseeing how SIMD instructions work\nin Rust.\n\n\nLong story short, SIMD instructions allow you to perform the same operation on multiple data\nelements simultaneously by vectorizing your data, hence the name,\nSingle Instruction Multiple Data\n\nI decided to use Rust's packed_simd, Nightly only\ncrate to achieve this. That crate supports a wide variety of different register sizes, in my case\nI was interested in f64x2 and\nf64x8 which pack 2 and 8 64-bit\nfloating point numbers into a single register respectively.\nI had already written non-SIMD code so I just had to start reworking it to emit SIMD instructions.\nI started working towards making f64x2 work and I eventually arrived at the following code:\n\nFor the purposes of this post, we only care about the following:\n\nSimd&lt;[f64; 2]&gt;\nf64x2\n\nSomewhat interestingly enough, if we head over to\nthe docs, we'll see that the latter\nis just an alias for the former:\n\nOf course, this is only for f64x2s and I just mentioned I also wanted to have f64x8s, this sounds\nextremely repetitive!!!\nSeems like something we could solve using generics!\n\nAs a side note, this was done for the educational purposes of both myself and whoever is reads\nthis post, please do not create unnecessary abstractions in your code (especially as\nconvoluted as a macro) when the alternative is writing another 3 lines of code!\n\nTrying to Generify Our Function\nThis didn't feel that hard so I immediately tried generifying the map method.\nI started off with this:\n\nLooks about what you'd expect right? We want to essentially generify over 2 possible values of N,\nnamely 2 and 8 so let's make that a generic then! Well, the compiler does not like that:\n\nThe same not a value error occurs in all usages of N, so what is going on?\nPeeking into the Simd type docs\nwe see that it uses this\nSimdArray trait which\napparently takes in a const N usize. Maybe all we have to do is just mimic that and then it will\njust work then (?)\n\nBut this still fails to compile:\n\nWell we are now getting a different error so there's that I guess. If we actually read the error,\nwe'll see that SimdArray is not implemented for [f64; N]. This is essentially enforcing that SIMD\narrays only have some select sizes that make sense. For example, [f64; 2] and [f64; 8] are\nvalid as they fit 2 and 8 f64s into 128 and 512 registers respectively but [f64; 3] for\nexample is not valid as there is no 192-bit register.\nWe can easily add that as a where clause in our function definition however:\n\nFinally this builds and all our problems are gone! Now we just have to add back the actual code!\nOf course we can't add that f64x2::splat stuff, we need to also make that generic. Well we did see\nthat f64x2 was just an alias for Simd&lt;[f64; 2]&gt;; so we should be able to just use that!\n\nAnd we get an error again :(\n\nGetting a Little Bit Off-Topic\nAt this point it started feeling like this might not be possible in Rust at least for the time\nbeing... until I found this post talking\nabout const generics which ignited some amount of hope in me.\nThe post essentially arrives at this handy trick:\n\nThis essentially allows us to express certain limitations that any data can have at compile time.\nWe could for example write something like this:\n\nAnd this crashes because IsTwoOrEight is obviously not implemented for 3!\n\nI found this super cool for some reason and surely it would work if we added this to our previous\ncode! I mean after all, we know that that darn trait is implemented for [f64; 2] and [f64; 8]!\n\nWell darn\n\nWhat's annoying with this is that outright using 2 or 8 compiles with no issues!\n\nI believe we have made it to the limits of the Rust compiler here; even if conceptually this is\nfine, the compiler is not convinced.\n\nIt is worth noting here that if the crate itself had used some traits for this and made their\nimplementation generic over them, what we are trying to do here would probably  maybe work!\nOr maybe there's another way of doing this that I am unware of, who knows.\n\nHere Come Macros! (Finally)\nNow credit to where credit is due, if I hadn't watched this video\nsometime during the 3 or so days I spent working on the project I would've probably not thought\nof using macros at all so definitely go and give it a watch!\nThe one sentence Tantan said that stuck with me was \"Let's go ahead and copy our [...] code and\npaste it into this macro\".\nI know this probably seems like a very silly thing to find useful but it did kind of change how I\nthought about macros. I often felt like because of how complex many of these macros get and because\nof how heavily certain projects use them to the point where it feels like they barely have any\nactual code, they surely must be pre-meditated.\nWell, maybe. But they definitely don't need to be. The whole premature optimization/abstraction\nsurely applies to macros, you should first build a solution that does not use macros and then\nonly after careful consideration, should you consider adding them as\nthey are not all sunshine and rainbows.\nAs someone on the above-linked Reddit thread elegantly put it;\n\n\"Pros: you can use macros to solve your problem\nCons: you need to use macros\"\n\nOk enough talking, let's actually make the thing.\nActually Making the Thing\nAs a reminder: we want a macro that can essentially produce the following 2 methods:\n\nLet's start by just making one of them. I first created a file simd_boilerplate.rs which will\nhouse the macro and then, well, just copied my code over\n\nJust as before, we need to somehow put all those 2s behind a variable:\n\nThis actually works fine! We just need to call crate::simd_boilerplate!(2); in the file where\nwe want the method to be dumped into and we can use it just like any other method!\nWe still have one final problem though. If we try and call our macro again with 8, we'll get an\nerror since we will be essentially creating the same method map_simd_f64x2 twice. There are a\nfew ways around this, the one I chose was to use the paste\ncrate.\nAlso, how come any time you find a neat crate that does exactly what you need it's always made by\nthat David Tolnay guy? Anyway.\nThe code for that looks pretty simple:\n\nAnd we're done!\nCalling crate::simd_boilerplate!(2); and crate::simd_boilerplate!(8); will create the\nmap_simd_f64x2 and map_simd_f64x8 methods we wanted respectively!\nClosing\nWhat did we learn from all this? Well, I guess macros are kinda neat sometimes albeit not too useful\nin this case, saving like 30 lines of code is not that amazing of a developer experience upgrade\nis it? Well perhaps more importantly we figured out how to write those macros, and we also figured\nout how to use const generics, what they can do and that cool little trick with the compile time\nvalue checks! All that because I decided I wanted to use SIMD on a little project in my past time.\nWhat I'm trying to say is that being curious and building stuff is the best way to learn new things\nand we should all do that as much as we can.\nBest case scenario, what you learn through this is useful to you sometime in the future, worst case,\nit's just fun.\n\nAlso please join the Rust community Discord! The people\nthere are wonderful and without their help, I would've stopped trying before I even made it to\nconst generics :)\nDidn't know where else to put this.\n\nTill next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/simple_rust_macros/","title":"Simple Rust Function Macros"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/writing-workflow/":{"body":"Introduction\nIn my last post I mentioned that because the post was so long\ncompared to what I usually put out, I ended up improving my CI to help me catch some errors more\neasily.\nI found it quite useful and I've actually been using parts of it for many of my notes and my ongoing\nBachelor thesis so I felt like sharing it!\nMy Workspace\nIt is worth mentioning that my blog posts are written in Markdown and as I'm a fan of markup\nlanguages (over say Microsoft Word or something), my thesis is written in Typst.\nI'm bringing this up because if you do use fancier environments like Word, there are probably\nmore convenient ways of achieving the improvements I'm going to talk about. If you do write loads\nof text in a code editor like me however, you might find something useful in the rest of this post!\nSpell Checking\nThe first (and arguably more important) change I made was performing spell checking in my CI! I\ncannot believe it took me this long to even consider adding something like this. I think that's\nbecause VSCode does do some spell checking (or maybe it was some of my plugins?) but it was not\nalways correct, it was inconsistent, sometimes annoying and of course easy to miss.\nWhat I ended up doing is setting up CSpell. Their docs are pretty decent so I won't go into too\nmuch detail but essentially what you end up doing is\n\ncreating a config file cspell.config.yaml\ncreating a file of allowed words that cspell does not already accept project-words.txt\n\nIn the config you usually define things like what directories you actually want to spell check\n(you probably don't care about spell checking your node_modules or something) or maybe any regexes\nspecifying text you want to ignore, and a whole bunch more that I don't really care about.\nThe project-words file is also neat as a lot of programming related words are usually considered\ninvalid (and so are many names) and you get to keep all these exceptions in 1 place as a plaintext\nfile. You can of course add to this file manually or, as per\ntheir docs,\ndo something like\n\nto append to it all the words cspell currently considers wrong so you can decide which are\nwrong and which are false positives. Considering you are probably using git, you can very easily\nimmediately see which words were added to this dictionary so its easy to review them.\nRunning the spell checking in CI was trivial:\n\n\nClone the repo\nInstall cspell\nRun it\nProfit\n\nVery low effort addition that will save you lots of headaches.\nLink Checking?\nA tool I heard of a while ago but never tried out is Lychee. Lychee can scan your text files or\nwebpages and find all broken/dead links and mail addresses.\nI had not realized how many of the links I used in older posts were just not working any more 🗿\nI'll definitely start using things like archive.is more in the future to avoid this.\nSetting this up was a little bit more annoying (not to Lychee's fault, websites are just annoying\nto curl sometimes) but in the end I ended up with the following config:\n\nI think all of it is pretty self explanatory, as are\nthe docs.\nWhile locally you can just serve your site and run Lychee via\nlychee http://127.0.0.1:1111/posts/specific_post for new posts,\nrunning it in CI was a bit more annoying because I wanted to check all pages of my blog.\nWhat I ended up doing was use the sitemap (good chance your SSG generates one for you, try\n/sitemap.xml), pass it to this tool I found\nthat just parses it and extracts all the URLs it contains (admittedly this does not seem that\nhard to DIY but I am lazy) and finally past all the resulting links to lychee using xargs.\nThe CI job looks like this:\n\nIn short:\n\nClone the repo\nInstall lychee and its build dependencies\n+ sitemap2urllist (the tool I mentioned earlier) (line 16-17)\nI then serve my blog (which uses zola) and run lychee on the sitemap running in localhost\n(line 26)\n\nThis checks all links in my blog (both internal and external), pretty neat!\nThis does need to compile sitemap2urllist which takes like 2 minutes but I don't mind.\nClosing\nThat is all!\nThis was a pretty short post, not much else to talk about.\nTill next time!\n","id":"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/writing-workflow/","title":"My writing workflow"},"https://antoniosbarotsis.github.io/posts/zip_it_and_ship_it/":{"body":"Introduction\nI recently started working on a command line tool that uses git hooks to remind you to run your\ntests and builds before pushing your code among other stuff and I decided to package that and\npublish it so anyone could use it. The project itself is nothing too impressive or innovative\nso in this post I will be mostly focusing on the packaging and publication process rather than\nthe project itself but in case you are interested in checking it out, click\nhere and go make some issues :)\nI'll be explaining how I published said package and how to make a Github Actions CD workflow\nto publish your new releases automatically.\nWhy\nI feel like most if not all developers find the idea of making their work available for anyone\nto check out and use an exciting one and I definitely relate to that. I personally really like\nworking on things that can be used by other developers specifically and that's the main reasons\nwhy I started this project and why I decided to make it easily accessible to anyone (unless\nyou are not on windows because I was too lazy to check how that would work).\nI decided early on that I wanted to publish my code on 2 platforms; the package manager of my\nlanguage of choice (in this case, NuGet) and a more general purpose package manager like\nChocolatey so that my audience would not be limited to developers\nfrom my tech stack only.\nWhat did I build exactly\nThe project was built using C# mostly because of this\nvideo I came across (great YouTuber by the way, make sure to check his channel out for C# content). TLDR; C#\nhas this thing called dotnet tools which\nare essentially command line applications that are very easy to make and package. The linked video walks you\nthrough creating one from scratch.\nUploading to NuGet\nPreparing\nOnce you have your CLI tool up and running there's only that many steps left to push it to NuGet.\nThe mentioned video already guides you through adding most of the stuff that you need in your .csproj\nfile but here's a few more things you might want to add:\n\n\nA README file\nIf you want your NuGet package to display the README file you spent hours filling with meaningless\nbadges, this is for you. All you have to do is add the following:\n\nThis tells NuGet to use our README.md file as the package README file but for that to work we must\nmake sure that this is packaged into our nupkg file. This might be different in your project but\nmy project has a separate folder for the actual code instead of it also being in the root of the project\n\nBecause of that, my Include parameter goes a directory up to reference the README file.\n\n\nOther useful tags might include RepositoryUrl to link your Github repo and PackageTags\nto provide a list of space-delimited tags for your package.\n\n\nI do also recommend specifying the RuntimeIdentifier to something like win-x64 although from\nwhat I understand this is not necessary but better safe than sorry!\n\n\nPushing the Package\nThat pretty much concludes the needed preparations for NuGet so time to actually push the thing.\nRun dotnet pack and you should get something along the lines of Successfully created package 'path/to/package.nupkg'.\nNext you want to grab yourself a NuGet API Key from here\nand run the following command:\n\nIf all goes well your package will be soon available on NuGet! Wasn't that simple?\nUploading to Chocolatey\nPreparing\nChocolatey requires you to provide a so called nuspec file which essentially provides some details\nfor your package. I personally found their docs\na bit confusing so if you get confused perhaps looking over at my repository could help you out more after you've\nread through them.\nYou will see that most of the stuff we specify are essentially the same as what we specified earlier for NuGet.\nOnly thing to note here is that you want to make sure that everything your package needs ends up in the tools\nfolder.\nCompiling\nUploading to Choco is a little more complicated. First of all, we need to compile our code to a single\nfile that has everything it needs to run bundled inside of it aka, a self contained file. It is also a\ngood idea to try and remove anything that is not used in terms of libraries considering how much larger\nthis file is going to be compared to the nupkg file we created earlier. Take a look at the docs for\ndotnet publish but TLDR; our command\nwill look something like this:\n\nThe reason why I specify these properties in the arguments of the command instead of in the csproj\nfile is because I would have to keep toggling them on and off depending on whether I was\ntargeting NuGet or Choco.\nI also specify the following in the csproj file to hopefully cut the executable file size down a\nbit more:\n\nThis should create a .exe file in the tools folder.\nPushing to Chocolatey\nWe are almost done! We now only need to run the following:\n\nYour API key can be found here and I do not know why\nnavigating to your profile page is so hard on their website.\nPublications on Chocolatey take way longer than NuGet (around 1-3 hours from personal experience)\nso sit back, go grab yourself some coffee, do some laundry, watch some YouTube, call your friends,\nfinish that one side project you abandoned 7 months ago, and check your email every 2 minutes in\ncase something goes wrong with the publication.\nTime to make a Workflow\nWorkflows are great! They do the boring, repetitive stuff for you automatically so you don't have\nto worry about forgetting them or doing something wrong, your project looks cooler and more serious\nwith them but most importantly, from what I understand, they qualify you for DevOps positions which\npay quite well so that's the main reason why you should care about making them 👍\nFeel free to check Github's docs.\nWe first start by specifying that we want our workflow to run on a new release publication\n\nThe release event has a bunch of different types that are explained very nicely in the documentation,\nI personally chose published which gets triggered for normal as well as pre-releases.\nThe good news is that this is a very simply workflow because we've already figured out how to do most\nof the work from our terminals!\n\nAs you can see, I checkout to my repository and set up Dotnet 6 before running the exact same commands\nI mentioned earlier. The only thing left now is to set the NUGET_API_KEY and CHOCO_API_KEY secrets\nin your github repository and create your first release!\nClosing\nOverall, I feel like this was a little less exciting than some of my other posts but to me, the whole process\nof publishing this project was quite exciting and I wanted to write something about it. Hopefully this inspires\nsomeone to go make his own package or library and make it available, same way Nick's video inspired me to work\non this project.
